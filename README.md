Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a professional Game Dev Engineer with passion about game development and programming.

Some of my core values:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as pairs and by generating space to talk.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment by listening to each other and removing waste.
* Generate trust by being transparent and having good communication skills.
* I don't believe in separated roles with separated responsibilities but I do believe in having different knowledge and points of view and achieving excellence by interacting to find the best product value from them. 

Some of my development best practices:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming

I love game jams, I have games at [itch.io](https://arielsan.itch.io/) and at [gemserk](https://blog.gemserk.com/games/) website. Here are some examples:

I worked at [Ironhide Game Studio](https://www.ironhidegames.com/) as Lead Game Engineer on [Iron Marines Invasion](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/ironmarinesinvasion), [Iron Marines](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/iron-marines), and as Programmer in some of the [Kingdom Rush](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/kingdom-rush-frontiers) game series too.

Previously, I worked at [Gemserk](https://github.com/gemserk) with [rgarat](https://github.com/rgarat) where we created lots of game prototypes using and collaborating with open source projects like LWJGL and [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) (among others) and learned a lot. We ended up porting [Clash of the Olympians](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/clash-of-the-olympians) to mobile devices.
