Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a professional Game Programmer and Computer Science Engineer since 2010 but I was passionate about game development all my life.

I currently work at [Ironhide Game Studio](https://www.ironhidegames.com/) in [Iron Marines](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/iron-marines) team as Lead Programmer, but previously worked in some of the [Kingdom Rush](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/kingdom-rush-frontiers) games too. 

Big fan of git and Github, using it in different projects since it was released I believe, here are my stats which I am super proud of:
