Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am a professional Game Programmer and Computer Science Engineer since 2010 but I was passionate about game development all my life.

I currently work at [Ironhide Game Studio](https://www.ironhidegames.com/) in [Iron Marines](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/iron-marines) team as Lead Game Engineer, but previously worked in some of the [Kingdom Rush](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/kingdom-rush-frontiers) games too. 

Previously, I worked at [Gemserk](https://github.com/gemserk) with [rgarat](https://github.com/rgarat) where we created lots of game prototypes using Java, LWJGL and [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) (among others) and learned a lot and we end up porting [Clash of the Olympians](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games/clash-of-the-olympians) to mobile devices. 

I have some personal open source projects like a [selection history plugin for Unity](https://github.com/acoppes/unity-history-window), among others, and also some shared projects as well, like all the stuff we did at Gemserk. I also helped with bug fixes pr in some other projects like LibGDX (a long time ago).

Big fan of git and Github, using it in different projects since it was released I believe, here are my stats which I am super proud of:
