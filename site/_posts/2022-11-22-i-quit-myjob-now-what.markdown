excerpt: Want to share a bit of my status right now and my current plan for the future now that I left my work after almost ten years.  
---

Leaving the company I worked on the last ten years of my life was a really hard decision to make but at the same time I feel it was the right one. Ironhide was growing too fast and too much and even though I don't disagree with that vision of big company I didn't want that for me. I still love the people and every game we did there and wish for them to keep making awesome games that I will totally play. I will always be a fan.

I still don't know for sure what I'm going to do next. I didn't have a plan before leaving like another job offering nor a part time project.  

My plan for now is to practice and learn a lot about different games I don't have experience while making small prototypes and experimenting with gameplay at the same time.  

Right now I am prototyping a Beat'em up of Ninjas (Naruto-like) with my friend [@pencilwing](https://pencilwing.itch.io/), with influence from the last [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361510/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Shredders_Revenge/) game. In my case to learn techniques like Input Buffering and Hit boxes and in the case of @pencilwing to practice high res animation in Pixelart. We both want to improve our game design skills too by experimenting and discussing ideas for the prototype.

While practicing and learning, I hope to find something interesting that I would want to continue developing, maybe try to get some funding and then publish. 

For now I am running on savings and I will try to do some freelance work or consultancy focusing on game development. Also, my awesome wife is supporting me in this journey both in a psychological and financial way.

Wish me luck.
