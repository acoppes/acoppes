The last couple of months I was focused on marking (including the previous video) and legal stuff to have my own Company, [Pixel Core Games](https://x.com/pixelcoregames), and my steam account in order to publish the game. 

The idea is to start translating interest to the game into wishlists and from there use that to fuel the game development.

I am really happy with this achievement, hope you enjoy the video and steam page, and they are interesting enough for you to wishlist Ship Miner.

Thanks for reading!
