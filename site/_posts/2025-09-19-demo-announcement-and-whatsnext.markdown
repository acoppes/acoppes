I've just released the Demo of Ship Miner :rocket: Weeee!!! But, does that means the game is done? On the contrary, it is far from over, in this blogpost I will explain the current state, the updated roadmap and the new importance for having a Demo.

In a [previous post](/2025/03/29/shipminer-roadmap-to-demo.html) I explained why I wanted to have a Demo before, and my mental plan was to have it by the end of June (and we are in September already). Yeah, I kinda failed that mental plan but as a tradeoff I started a private Playtest in mid July and it worked pretty well.

The private Playtest ended up having 490 subscribers (today data) where 184 of those players actually played the game. From those, some of them joined Discord to share feedback and ideas, others filled the feedback form, others sent me emails and some of them even recorded videos and shared to me. It was so awesome and I am so grateful with all of them. In general, it was good feedback, pretty aligned with what I envision for the game and also helped me confirming some strengths but also some fears so I can attack them more focused now.

At some point I wasn't sure anymore about having a Demo since the players from the playtest were helping me so much but at the same time after analyzing and also taking [advice](https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/09/16/10-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-hold-back-on-contacting-content-creators/) from other devs I decided to publish a Demo with the objectives of participate in festivals, contact content creators and also reach a broader audience to get even more feedback. 

It is a great milestone and I am super happy with it.

## Roadmap

The game is far from being done. From the last time I shared the current state, I was wondering if the game should be more base building in one asteroid or keep the travel to asteroids, among other things. Well, I ended up deciding to keep the original plan of traveling from asteroid to asteroid and deciding destinations but that is not in the Demo right now. That is might feel so strange, such an important part of the game is not there, but the truth is that what I have shares a lot the general experience of the game in terms of mood, controls, feelings, etc, so it still makes sense to have an early demo.

So the current roadmap includes now:

* Destination selection (this includes making interesting changes among asteroids)
* More content (enemies with different patterns, more technology, different ships to start the game)
* Game modes (custom, sandbox, etc)
* Localization in at least 4 languages.
* More options to customize game.
* Accessibility features
* Achievements
* Retro visual effects like scanlines, crt, etc.
* Better Savegame System (continue where you were)
