excerpt: I pushed myself to make a 3d game for Ludum Dare 52 last weekend and felt like a beginner during the process but it felt really good and I learned new things. I am super happy with that. In this blog post I will share the experience and some of the technical details of the solution.

When I first read the jam’s theme, “Harvest”, the first thing that came to my mind was Dune 2, the 1992 PC game. I played a lot that game when I was young and I remember it with much love. One of the first things I recall was the feeling of anxiety when the Sand Worm was coming to get your harvester, the most important unit in the game, and you had to forget everything else to save it. 

After thinking a bit about the theme and about Dune, I decided to create a game around that feeling. 

At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to give the player the power of the Shai-hulud and the game was going to be about hunting harvesters or the other way around, you are the harvester escaping the god. I decided to go for the second just because the game was more clear in my mind.

Basically, in the game you control a Harvester and have to harvest spice, at some point a Sand Worm tries to eat you and you have to escape and repeat until a target spice is reached or until you get eaten.

Sometimes people ask me which language and/or technologies I used to make a game, and I though not so frequent I share an extensive list, here it is:

Unity and C#
URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
Post processinig effects like bloom, vignete, etc.



Terrain

The first thing I wanted to achieve was the sensation of Arrakis’ dunes (hence its other name Dune). For that I decided to use Unity’s terrain tool.

The Harvester

The Sandworm
