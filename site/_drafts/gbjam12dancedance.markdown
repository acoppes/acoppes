A couple of weeks ago was the game jam [GBJAM12](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-12), where you have to make a game with some of the Game Boy Color limitations like 4 colors only, a resolution of 160x144 pixels, etc (more details on the jam page), and with a friend of mine, [Esteban](https://x.com/esti_uy), we decided to participate. The theme was Spooky and our idea was to make some kind of dance dance revolutions with zombies, inspired by Michael Jackson's Thriller. 

Our game is named Dance Zombie Dance, and you have to help Michael Johnson to complete the dance sequence to make the dancing zombies happy and don't eat him alive.

Before joining this jam I asked myself if I should do it or not. The last year, one of the main reasons for doing small games and/or participating in jams was to find a game to work on but now that I have Ship Miner, have the other reasons enough value for me to continue participating in game jams compared to the time investment?

These are the main reasons I normally consider when joining a game jam:

* Test and find new game ideas and maybe end up with the next game to make. 
* Challenge ourselves to do something new or in a different way. This could be the idea, a technical thing, a change in my process, hard skills, etc. 
* If working with a team, test how well we work together, how we distribute responsibilities, do we have synergy? do we want to work together again in the future?
* Take some fresh air by stop doing what I do everyday. This also helps to return to day to day stuff with renewed energies and motivated. 
* In the case of some game jams, the best rated games might reach some news sites, streamers, etc, and that could benefit developers getting attention and visibility. 
* And, obviously and not less important than the other things: __Have Fun__.
* Being part of the game jam community and/or specific game jam community, in my case I am a kind of fan of the GBJAM and like to join it each time. 

I can't know beforehand the value of each reason, it is something I can only evaluate __after__ joining the game jam but what I know is I want to invest time in them every once in a while and I also know that I normally end up feeling fulfilled.

So I decided to participate and after the jam was concluded, here is my evaluation and conclusions.

First, we decided to make something we never did before, a musical game, from the

### Technical

## Team

## New challenges & Fresh Air

It feels really good and motivational to do something new and different from time to time. It is also an opportunity to test the engine and process in a different context.

# Challenge myself on doing more complex art

One core challenge that we had when we started was that we had no artist. I mean, I do the art for Ship Miner but it is super limited compared to what people do for this jam. However, I wanted to test myself and to do something different. After the jam results, we got placed 70 of 400 in graphics, with a score of 4.185 over 5, which felt awesome. 

# Technical challenge for the musical part 

In terms of technical challenges, the main one was to define how to show the notes based on the song we play, and for that we decided to export the wav/mp3 for the song and also the midi file used to create it, in that way we could get information from the midi and match it with what is being played, and that is how we show the notes in the lanes. 

## Team

Esteban already did the music for some of the game jams I participated the last year, but normally the process was more like I was working in the jam and at some point I asked some music, we talked a bit about what I wanted and then he did something and normally was pretty awesome already so that was the end of the process.

Recently I asked him to work with me in making the music (and probably sound effects too) for Ship Miner, but one thing we quickly noticed is that I always include him later on, it is ok, but what about doing something together from the start, and collaborate in the idea conception. So for that reason we thought about doing some jam together at some point and since we both share some love for GameBoy, we decided that the GBJAM would be the most appropriate jam to do it. 

## Marketing

So this is the less important reason to join in terms of it is the less likely to happen but in the case of doing an interesting enough game, we could get some attention and use that to get Ship Miner more visibility. It happened before with Nekosama, a game I did with another friend, that got a nice place in the gbjam and we got a couple of streamers to play it.

## Tradition

I already joined this jam multiple times and for some reason I really love it. Some great games appear with the limitations of the gameboy, I played lots of interesting things that other devs did and also the community was always really cool. Maybe I also have some nostalgia for the Game Boy even though I never had one.

# Conclusions

How much I invested in this jam? around 25hs to 30hs, that means less time on Ship Miner and/or Cleared Hot this month.
