A couple of weeks ago was the game jam [GBJAM12](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-12), where you have to make a game with some of the Game Boy Color limitations like 4 colors only, a resolution of 160x144 pixels, etc (more details on the jam page), and with a friend of mine, [Esteban](https://x.com/esti_uy), we decided to participate. The theme was Spooky and our idea was to make some kind of dance dance revolutions with zombies, inspired by Michael Jackson's Thriller. 

Our game is named Dance Zombie Dance, and you have to help Michael Johnson to complete the dance sequence to make the dancing zombies happy and don't eat him alive.

Before joining this jam I asked myself if I should do it or not. One of the main reasons I had the last year for doing small games and participating in game jams was to find a game to work on but now I have Ship Miner. So, I have to consider if the other reasons are important enough for me compared to investing time in my game.

These could be a list of reasons I might consider when joining a game jam:

* Test and find new game ideas and maybe end up with the next game to make. 
* Challenge myself to do something new or something in a different way. This could be the idea, a technical challenge, a change in the process, among other things. 
* If working with a team, test how well we work together, how we distribute responsibilities, do we have synergy? do we want to work together again in the future?
* Take some fresh air by stop doing what I do everyday. This also helps to return to the day to day stuff with renewed energies and motivated, and even with new ideas.
* In the case of some game jams, the best rated games might reach some news sites, streamers, etc, and that could benefit developers by getting attention and visibility. 
* Be part of the game jam community or a specific game jam community, in my case I am a kind of fan of the GBJAM and like to join it each year. 
* And not less important than the other things: __Have Fun__.

I can't know beforehand the value of each reason, it is something I can only evaluate __after__ joining the game jam but what I know is I want to invest time in them every once in a while and I also know that I normally end up feeling fulfilled.

So, I will share some of my conclusions of participating in this game jam this year.

As I said before, we decided to make something we never did before, a musical game inspired by Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolutions but for Game Boy. So here we had the challenge of processing the music in a way we can show it in the game as part of the game mechanics. In order to do this, we exported both an mp3 and a midi file, and we processed the midi file to get the time where the notes should be shown to the player, processing that was a bit complex but we managed to do it but games that depend on exact timing need a lot of tuning to make them feel as nice as possible and that was something that we couldn't achieve in the end. 

For Esteban making retro music that sounds good for Game Boy was new and something to learn and experiment during the jam. The good thing here is that we were inspired by Thriller and the idea was to make some kind of adaptation of that song to be played so we didn't have to create a song from 0. We ended up doing two songs and they matched really well the game and the theme, and the game was placed #22 in Soundtrack/SFX with a score of 4.185 of 5 so we are pretty happy with that result.

Another thing we decided was that I was going to make the art for the game, even though I never did art for Game Boy before, I really liked the idea to challenge myself in this aspect, more now that I am doing the art for Ship Miner myself. The idea was to have the zombies and the main character looking to the camera and show different dance steps inspired by Thriller. The UI should be clear enough, showing the notes coming and when you correctly play them, etc, and considering we have only 4 colors it was a real challenge. In this case, we also managed to get a score of 4.185 of 5 and that placed us #70 in graphics. Again, super happy with this result and how the game ended up looking.

## New challenges & Fresh Air

It feels really good and motivational to do something new and different from time to time. It is also an opportunity to test the engine and process in a different context.

# Challenge myself on doing more complex art

One core challenge that we had when we started was that we had no artist. I mean, I do the art for Ship Miner but it is super limited compared to what people do for this jam. However, I wanted to test myself and to do something different. After the jam results, we got placed 70 of 400 in graphics, with a score of 4.185 over 5, which felt awesome. 

# Technical challenge for the musical part 

In terms of technical challenges, the main one was to define how to show the notes based on the song we play, and for that we decided to export the wav/mp3 for the song and also the midi file used to create it, in that way we could get information from the midi and match it with what is being played, and that is how we show the notes in the lanes. 

## Team

Esteban already did the music for some of the game jams I participated the last year, but normally the process was more like I was working in the jam and at some point I asked some music, we talked a bit about what I wanted and then he did something and normally was pretty awesome already so that was the end of the process.

Recently I asked him to work with me in making the music (and probably sound effects too) for Ship Miner, but one thing we quickly noticed is that I always include him later on, it is ok, but what about doing something together from the start, and collaborate in the idea conception. So for that reason we thought about doing some jam together at some point and since we both share some love for GameBoy, we decided that the GBJAM would be the most appropriate jam to do it. 

## Marketing

So this is the less important reason to join in terms of it is the less likely to happen but in the case of doing an interesting enough game, we could get some attention and use that to get Ship Miner more visibility. It happened before with Nekosama, a game I did with another friend, that got a nice place in the gbjam and we got a couple of streamers to play it.

## Tradition

I already joined this jam multiple times and for some reason I really love it. Some great games appear with the limitations of the gameboy, I played lots of interesting things that other devs did and also the community was always really cool. Maybe I also have some nostalgia for the Game Boy even though I never had one.

# Conclusions

How much I invested in this jam? around 25hs to 30hs, that means less time on Ship Miner and/or Cleared Hot this month.
