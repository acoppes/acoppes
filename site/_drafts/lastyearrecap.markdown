## Intro

When I started this journey of making my own games, I evaluated my situation and then defined some objectives to achieve and pillars to have in mind all the time.

I was super inspired by [Sokpop Collective](https://sokpop.itch.io/) and [PUNKCAKE Délicieux](https://punkcake.itch.io/) (among others) who develop small games super fast and I wanted to achieve something similar at some point. 

So my pillars were:

* **Long term growth**: each time I work on something, it has to have some value for me in the future or I should modify the premise to have some value for me in the future. 
* **Tools and workflows**: create and improve tools and workflows all the time to reduce non creative time. 
* **Overcome weakness**: train, improve, find different ways to attack my weakness or and sometimes avoid them and just focus on my strengths. 
* **Start small / Mini games**: don't make an MMO, attack things I can control both in content and scope.

And my objectives were:

* **Find a game to work on**: my idea was to participate in many game jams as possible to try different things and find something interesting, while developing new tools and workflows to become faster. And also in that process, find the proper scope for my games.
* **Find a way to have art in my games**: for this issue I had like different paths in mind to explore like buying assets, hiring an artist, find a teammate/partner and even start doing the art myself.

I didn't have a clear roadmap, it was more like I want to do this or that so my actions should reflect that, and at some point I will start completing the objectives.

Ok, that was the intro, now I want to share a more detailed story of what happened in 2023. You can jump to [Conclusions](#conclusions) if you want the end of the story.

## 2023 review in detail

### Beat'em up

I've started by working on a Beat'em up with my friend [Franco Zucchi](https://twitter.com/pencilwing). I was super excited with this one, really wanted to learn from this genre while also doing something together. It was a ninja game really inspired by Naruto. I decided to use the TMNT assets to start prototyping and Franco did the main character concepts and some placeholder animations to work with.

In the end I quickly found out that it wasn't the time to do something together but instead of cancelling the project I decided to continue it by switching to buy assets and see what I can do. I knew this genre is not so strong in terms of how much money they generate but I continued its development as a learning process.

I iterated a lot, with different assets packs, and at some point I even started buying some, these are different versions of the same game:

After those iterations, it ended up looking something like this:

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/assets/2023review/beatemup-gameplay3.gif" />
</div>

The main reason was that I was reducing assets resolution and complexity to see if it was something I could modify if I had to, or if I had to hire someone it should be easier for them too, compared to the initial version.

During this process I found [@penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) assets pack and I fell in love with his art style and how he animates. One thing I found out was that, even with low res asset packs I found myself limited pretty fast when I wanted to do try something new and I didn't feel comfortable with modifying the assets for my needs yet.

After spending lots of time in this game, I wasn't so sure how to stop working on it, I mean, I knew this was a learning process but it was becoming a project more and more, I was thinking lots of ideas I wanted to test, but I knew this wasn't the right project. Thankfully, a Ludumdare was coming and I wanted to participate, and that was the proper excuse to stop thinking in this game and do something different to clear my mind.

### LDJAM - Spice Must Flow

Tell about the jam

Participating in a LDJAM to make the harvester game helped me in abandon that game, the objective was kinda done and I was like continuing making the game which I knew it wasn't something interesting to finish. 

I decided to create my own "jams"

Loved doing some low poly 3d stuff, even though it wasn't completed.

### Stranded: planet survivor - personal jam

- some 3d low poly + pixelart explorations here

PLAY HERE

### Hunter games - personal jam

PLAY HERE

### Super dino box

At this point, I was interested in having some lateral income but related to games, I was already working on an app for some friends but wanted to be 100% in games at some point. 

So I decided to explore the web portal [Poki](https://poki.com/) as a possibility but since I had two friends that were in a similar situation, we decided to start doing something together. 

After exploring other games and also based on our interests, we decided to make a game like a Super Crate Box but with Dinosaurs.

After a week of work, we decided it was going to take longer that we wanted to spend so we aborted the idea. However, we were still interested in trying to do something for Poki at some point in the future.

### Endless Runner => Gorilla Jones

Tell about poki too, tell about not finding a team either here.
Tell about spending a lot of time on something that wasn't in the right direction (mobile, poki web, ads, etc)

### low res jam - Abduction

Started exploring art styles I had some control over it, made a fun toy to play with, but still not finding a game and not exploring the GAME part so much.

### Mini rts experience

### A failed GBJAM and Neko platformer

More art style exploration, two prototypes here, the "there is no room in space" and "nekoplatformer"

### A successful 1bit jam I never participated - Ship miner

Found an art style I like and control, people are interested. 
Found a game I like to play while developing and people seem interested in that too.

## Conclusion

About the objectives I defined when started, here are the conclusions about them for 2023. 

### Find a game

I experimented with different games in terms of genres, a bit with different art styles

Improved my tools and workflows while doing different games too.

### Find an art style

#### Buy assets

Tried buying assets, it worked pretty well as starting point, there are a lot of assets packs out there, I super recommend @penusbmic ones (but probably because I love pixel art). But using assets has some issues. One is, when you try to expand, you need an artist or pay or convince the original artist to expand the asset pack the way you want. The other is that it is normally a creative limitation, sometimes this is good since you want to do something super related with those assets, and sometimes it is really bad since you can't move outside those bounds. 

#### Hire artists

Didn't try hiring an artist, the reason was, if I have to hire an artist, I want to be pretty sure about the game I am doing. So is something I could try in the future. But one thing I wanted to try was to hire different artists for specific tasks to start knowing them and experiment the workflow, etc, but I had no money to spend on that once I decided that could've been a good move.

#### Find teammate/partner

Tried to work with two friends to see if I find a partner there but with no luck, both experiments were pretty unsuccessful, it wasn't the right time to work together I suppose or my expectations were pretty high. I am talking with new people (juan and penusbmic, artists) and at some point I want to experiment doing a small thing together, maybe I can find partnership there. I also was in contact with Calix Jumio (dev in general) a lot, we normally share stuff and discuss, I feel pretty comfortable talking with him but we never had a chance to do something together either. 

#### Find my own style

I found a simple style with lowres low color palette games that I like and I can control/hack pretty well and I believe this is something that will allow me to prototype more and even grow at some point, so I feel pretty successful here.

WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW

MY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

As always, thanks for my friends Rubén and Juan Andrés Nin for being there all the time discussing how to survive in the industry.

Others

* met new friends 
* 

but I was on my own, I didn't have a team but also in some way I wanted to be able to work with other devs without the need to become a Company.
