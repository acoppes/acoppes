## Intro

When I started this journey of making my own games, I analyzed my situation and defined some objectives to achieve, and some pillars to have in mind all the time, things that might change over time but were a good starting point to have.

I was super inspired by [Sokpop Collective](https://sokpop.itch.io/) and [PUNKCAKE Délicieux](https://punkcake.itch.io/) (among others), both teams develop small games, with great quality, super fast and I wanted to achieve something similar at some point. 

The pillars I defined were:

* **Long term growth**: each time I work on something, it has to have some value for me in the future or I should modify the premise to have some value for me in the future. 
* **Tools and workflows**: create and improve tools and workflows all the time to minimize non creative time. 
* **Overcome weakness**: train, improve, find different ways to attack my weakness while also improving my strengths. 
* **Start small / Mini games**: don't make an MMO, attack things I can control both in content and scope, so for example, if a project becomes too big, reduce it or cancel it.

And my objectives were:

* **Find a game to work on**: my idea was to participate in many game jams as possible to try different things and find something interesting. During that process, find the proper scope for my games and develop new tools and workflows to become faster.
* **Find a way to have art in my games**: for this issue I had like different paths in mind to explore like buying assets, hiring an artist, find a teammate/partner and even start doing the art myself, things to explore over time.

I didn't have a clear roadmap, it was more like I want to do this or that so my actions should reflect that, and at some point I will start completing the objectives.

Ok, that was the intro, now I want to share a more detailed story of what happened in 2023 but you can jump to [Conclusions](#conclusions) if you want to just read the end of the story.

## 2023 review in detail

### Beat'em up

I've started by working on a Beat'em up with my friend [Franco Zucchi](https://twitter.com/pencilwing). I was super excited with this one, really wanted to learn from this genre while also doing something together. It was a ninja game really inspired by Naruto. I decided to use the TMNT assets to start prototyping and Franco did the main character concepts and some placeholder animations to work with.

*Note: this was before 2023, but for now I just considered all together since I don't have a lot to share about 2022.*

</div>

We quickly found out that it wasn't the right time to do something together, Franco was really busy with his own Company and games at that time. However, instead of cancelling the project I decided to continue it as a learning process and purchased some assets as an experiment too.

I iterated a lot, with different assets packs, these are different versions of the same game:

</div>

After those iterations, it ended up looking something like this:

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/assets/2023review/beatemup-gameplay3.gif" />
</div>

Even though it started with bigger and maybe better looking assets, the process was to reduce assets resolution and complexity to see if it was something I could modify if I had to, or if I had to hire someone it should be easier for them too, compared to the initial version.

During this process I found [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) and his assets pack and I fell in love with the art and animation style. One thing I realized was that, even with low res asset packs I found myself limited pretty fast when I wanted to try something new and I didn't feel ready to modify the assets for my needs (yet?). 

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/beatemup)

After spending a lot of time in this game, I wasn't so sure how to stop working on it, I mean, I knew this was a learning process but it was becoming a project more and more, I was thinking lots of ideas I wanted to try but I believed this wasn't the right project. Thankfully, a Ludumdare was coming and that was the proper excuse to stop thinking in this game and do something different to clear my mind.

### Spice Must Flow

It was [Ludum dare 52](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52) and the theme was: Harvest. I did a game about Dune Harvesters and the Sand Worm, [here is a blog post](/2023/01/12/ludumdare52jam) about it.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/assets/ldjam52-travel_01.gif" />
</div>

It was super fun to do and I had the chance to try something different, a low poly 3d game with vehicle driving mechanics. 

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/spice-must-flow)

Participating in this game jam refreshed me and helped me deciding to abandon the Beat'em up and go back to make mini games and/or prototypes to try to find something interesting I want to, and I can, finish to the end. I decided to start making my own "game jams", where I had to make a game in one or two weeks, and let my spice flow.... :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

### Stranded: planet survivor

This was a survivor game like Don't starve but Sci-fi, and was heavily inspired by [Penusbmic Stranded asset pack](https://itch.io/c/3652990/stranded-series). The story was that you are one of those guys that go to explore a planet in FTL and never return, so you are now alone in an unknown planet and you have to find a way to fix your ship and return to your crew.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/jams_survivor-screenshot-01.gif" />
</div>

After one or two weeks of development, I only had some world generation but there was no real game, only exploration, it was fun to make but trying to do all the ideas I had for that game in two weeks was impossible.

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/survivorgame)

*A glitch in the matrix: At some point in the future (don't remember exactly when), and inspired by other developers, I experimented mixing low poly cellshaded 3d with pixel art billboards thinking in better world generation for the game, here is a video of that:*

<span>I really love how this looks too, but didn't explore more, maybe something for the future</span> 
</div>

### Hunter games

My next mini game was Hunter Games. You play a hunter competing for your tribe and you have to hunt more creeps than the other hunters in order to save your tribe.  

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/jams_huntersgame-screenshot-01.gif" />
</div>

I wasn't looking for something new with this minigame, just wanted to complete a mini experience and have a game loop, even though it was pretty simple, but compared with the previous game which has no game loop at all. I was super happy with the result and this game became the core for other prototypes and mini experiences I did later.

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/huntersgame)

*Fun Fact: while writing this blogpost I though this game was released mid 2023 but when I checked out I released it around [Feb 13](https://twitter.com/arielsan/status/1625207607295188992), which means my memory is probably mixing up stuff.*

### Super Dino Box

At this point I was already [working on an app for some friends and also teaching in University](2023/03/04/update-current-plan.html) but I also wanted to be 100% focused on games in the future. For that reason, I thought about having a lateral income related with games, maybe with mobile and/or web games. 

A friend of mine was developing games for [Poki](https://poki.com/) at that time and recommended it so I decided to see if I could publish something there, and since I had two other friends (Matías Sniadower and Enzo Gaiero) who were interested in experimenting this too, we decided to do something together. I was super excited since we were a more complete team: an artist, a game designer and a programmer, and if this worked we could do more stuff together in the future.

After analyzing other games and also based on our interests, we decided to make a game like a Super Crate Box but with Dinosaurs that should take around one month of work to complete.

After a week of work we concluded it was going to take longer that we wanted to spend so we aborted the idea. However, we didn't lose interest in trying to do something for that web portal.

*Timeline: we are around March at this point.*

### Endless Runner -> Gorilla Jones

After Super Dino Box, I decided to keep working on a game with [platformer mechanics as a learning process](/2023/04/10/platformer_techniques_in_endless_runner.html) and that evolved into an endless runner, here is a version using other pack of assets from Penusbmic:

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/assets/endlessrunner-gameplay-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video> 
</div>

As I said before, we were still interested in publishing a game in Poki and thought that maybe an Endless Runner could be easy to do (big mistake) and a fit for the platform (another mistake xD). So Matías Sniadower and I decided to continue this project by make custom assets for it, and see what happens.

The game evolved to be Gorilla Jones:

<div class="post-image">
<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/assets/2023review/gorilla-teaser-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
</div>

During its development, we started interacting with Poki and had like 3 iterations but in the end they weren't interested in the game, it wasn't clear if they didn't like the genre or they were avoiding Unity games but we decided to not spend more time on it anyways. 

We decided to publish the game for free on itch, you can [play it here](https://arielsan.itch.io/gorillajones).

*Timeline: we started the game on March and released it on September.*

Working on this game was a good experiment that should've failed sooner (like 2 months before) but it didn't.

Some conclusions:

* Game wasn't published in Poki so we have no idea if that is a good platform and we also don't know how to publish a game there.
* We didn't set the proper expectations about working together, and I had big expectations in my mind but since Mati was working on other stuff a lot I didn't enjoy the process (super slow iteration, communication delays, etc).
* We spent like four months (part time) in something that didn't add a lot of value, and something we said it should've been completed in around one month.
* I had the chance to experiment more with procedural generation and also to learn some things about game design (Thanks Leandro and Enzo for that!).

During some gaps in its development (like waiting for poki or waiting for assets) I still did some mini game jams.

### Mini RTS experience

This is a micro RTS experience focused on micromanagement. I decided to use the core of Hunter games to start with but the game was pretty different, it was more about controlling multiple units and making them survive a difficult situation by using good micro management. I really love the genre and from time to time come back to try to develop something related to it.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/jams_rtsgame-screenshot-02.gif" />
</div>

With this game I also focused on having a game loop (win and lose) while also trying to improve the game feel (blood particles, dead bodies, etc). I obviously had more ideas in mind I couldn't try in time but I am still pretty happy with the game.

*Timeline: this game was developed in July and released at the beginning of August.*

### Abduction 101

While developing the last game, I was already looking a game jam to participate (not one of my own) and found the [low rez jam](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023). The idea is to make a low resolution (64x64) game in two weeks and there were different optional themes that you could pick, even more than one if you want. In my case, I decided to consider Invasion and Catch'Em All, and made a game named Abduction 101, where you play an UFO abducting people, destructing stuff and invading earth.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/jams-lowrezjam-2023-01.gif" />
</div>

*Timeline: this game was released mid August.*

One thing I loved about joining this jam was that it was the first time I made all the assets for a game, and it didn't look bad. Having a limitation in resolution and colors allowed me to create art by brute force in some way, and I felt really in control of the development, at last. This opened a new possibility that I decided to explore more: make lower resolution games and do the art myself.    

### A failed GBJAM?

On September, there was going to be a [new GBJam](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-11), a jam I normally love to participate and Franco and I were preparing for it some time before it started. We were discussing about making the second part of [Nekosama](https://arielsan.itch.io/neko-sama) and try to adapt the theme (not announced yet) in the way we can. I had really really big expectations. 

After the theme "Space" was announced, we quickly discussed some ideas to add to Nekosama and I developed some prototypes:

  <source src="/assets/2023review/nekosama2-kunai-swap-02.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<span>The idea was to use a kunai to switch places with stuff, like Minato does in Naruto anime</span> 
</div>

Even though we wanted to expand Nekosama, we thought that maybe this mechanic goes better with a 2d platformer game when making level/puzzles, so we tested changing that.

<div class="post-image">

  <source src="/assets/2023review/nekosama2-sidescroller-switchrooms.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</div>

But reality hit me hard here. Franco was busy again with its own Company (super understandable) and I felt like I was working super alone (super delayed communication) so after two days of that situation I decided I didn't want it and left the jam. I suppose I was failing with setting high expectations on working with friends/artists.

I was super demotivated and didn't want to do anything games related for a couple of days.

### Almost participating in the jam in the end?

By the weekend (almost at the end of the jam) I decided to start doing some mockups and found something I liked and recover motivation. I decided to create a game named "There is no room in space". It was like an enter the gungeon kind of game where you explore attachable rooms in space, like you decide where to move and the room was going to be attached (I never managed to do that xD).

<div class="post-image">

  <source src="/assets/2023review/noroominspace-gameplay-02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</div>

I obviously couldn't complete it in two days so I didn't publish it but there were some positive things here. I tried again low resolution concepts (and even animated the character) that I felt comfortable with and also I managed to make a lot of stuff in two days so I was improving my dev speed. I started to feel I could make a game by my own without an artist.

So my conclusion in the end was that, even though I didn't participate in the jam, it was a success in some way, I had the opportunity to test myself in creating art again, and also tested something new.

### Platformers hit me again

During the nekosama 2d prototype I got interested in learning more about level design, so I decided to continue that prototype a bit, here is where Nekoplatformer born. My focus was to make some levels based on the teleport mechanic while also try to do some low res assets again.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/assets/2023review/nekoplatformer-itch-cover-image.gif" />
</div>

I didn't explore a lot on puzzle/level design but I did some 1 bit palette low res art exploration, with particles and other stuff, and I thought: there is something interesting to continue exploring here.

</div>

You can [play the prototype here](https://arielsan.itch.io/nekoplatformer).

### A successful 1bit jam I never joined -> Ship miner

Found an art style I like and control, people are interested. 
Found a game I like to play while developing and people seem interested in that too.

## Conclusion

About the objectives I defined when started, here are the conclusions about them for 2023. 

### Find a game

I experimented with different games in terms of genres, a bit with different art styles

Improved my tools and workflows while doing different games too.

### Find an art style

#### Buy assets

Tried buying assets, it worked pretty well as starting point, there are a lot of assets packs out there, I super recommend @penusbmic ones (but probably because I love pixel art). But using assets has some issues. One is, when you try to expand, you need an artist or pay or convince the original artist to expand the asset pack the way you want. The other is that it is normally a creative limitation, sometimes this is good since you want to do something super related with those assets, and sometimes it is really bad since you can't move outside those bounds. 

#### Hire artists

Didn't try hiring an artist, the reason was, if I have to hire an artist, I want to be pretty sure about the game I am doing. So is something I could try in the future. But one thing I wanted to try was to hire different artists for specific tasks to start knowing them and experiment the workflow, etc, but I had no money to spend on that once I decided that could've been a good move.

#### Find teammate/partner

Tried to work with two friends to see if I find a partner there but with no luck, both experiments were pretty unsuccessful, it wasn't the right time to work together I suppose or my expectations were pretty high. I am talking with new people (juan and penusbmic, artists) and at some point I want to experiment doing a small thing together, maybe I can find partnership there. I also was in contact with Calix Jumio (dev in general) a lot, we normally share stuff and discuss, I feel pretty comfortable talking with him but we never had a chance to do something together either. 

#### Find my own style

I found a simple style with lowres low color palette games that I like and I can control/hack pretty well and I believe this is something that will allow me to prototype more and even grow at some point, so I feel pretty successful here.

WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW

MY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

As always, thanks for my friends Rubén and Juan Andrés Nin for being there all the time discussing how to survive in the industry.

Others

* met new friends 
* 

but I was on my own, I didn't have a team but also in some way I wanted to be able to work with other devs without the need to become a Company.
