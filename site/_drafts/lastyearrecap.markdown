## Intro

When I started with this journey of making games by my own, I first evaluated my situation and then defined some pillars and objectives for myself.

My pillars were:

* Long term growth
* Engine and tools
* Overcome weakness
* Start small / Mini games

I was super inspired by [Sokpop Collective](https://sokpop.itch.io/) and [PUNKCAKE Délicieux](https://punkcake.itch.io/) who develop small complete games super fast, I wanted to have something similar to them at some point. 

My objectives were:

* **Find a game to work on**: my idea was to participate in many game jams as possible to try different things and find something interesting, while developing new tools and engine to become faster.
* **Find a way to have art in my games**: for this issue I had like different paths in mind to explore:
  * Buy assets
  * Hire artists
  * Find a teammate/partner
  * Find a way to do the art myself 

I didn't have a clear roadmap, it was more like I want to do this or that so my actions should reflect that.

Ok, that was the intro, now a bit of story of what happened during 2023. You can jump to [Conclusions](#conclusions) if you want the end of the story quick.

## 2023 Recap in detail

### Beat'em up

I've started by working on a Beat'em up with my friend [Franco Zucchi](https://twitter.com/pencilwing). I was super excited with this one, really wanted to learn from this genre but I also wanted to do something together.

In the end I quickly found out that it wasn't the time to do something together but instead of cancelling the project I decided to continue it by switching to buy assets and see what I can do. I knew this genre is not so strong in terms of how much money they generate but I continued the development for the learning process. 

GIF OF END AND LINK TO PLAY

Something good I found in the middle was that I knew @penusbmic assets there, and I fall in love with the style. 

Quickly find that when I wanted to make new gameplay I needed new art I couldn't do it myself so buying asset packs wasn't a proper way.

### LDJAM - Spice Must Flow

Tell about the jam

Participating in a LDJAM to make the harvester game helped me in abandon that game, the objective was kinda done and I was like continuing making the game which I knew it wasn't something interesting to finish. 

I decided to create my own "jams"

### Stranded: planet survivor

### Hunter games

### Endless Runner / Gorilla Jones

Tell about poki too, tell about not finding a team either here.
Tell about spending a lot of time on something that wasn't in the right direction (mobile, poki web, ads, etc)

### low res jam - Abduction

Started exploring art styles I had some control over it, made a fun toy to play with, but still not finding a game and not exploring the GAME part so much.

### Mini rts experience

### A failed GBJAM and Neko platformer

More art style exploration, two prototypes here, the "there is no room in space" and "nekoplatformer"

### A successful 1bit jam I never participated - Ship miner

Found an art style I like and control, people are interested. 
Found a game I like to play while developing and people seem interested in that too.

## Conclusion

About the objectives I defined when started, here are the conclusions about them for 2023. 

### Find a game

I experimented with different games in terms of genres, a bit with different art styles

Improved my tools and workflows while doing different games too.

### Find an art style

#### Buy assets

Tried buying assets, it worked pretty well as starting point, there are a lot of assets packs out there, I super recommend @penusbmic ones (but probably because I love pixel art). But using assets has some issues. One is, when you try to expand, you need an artist or pay or convince the original artist to expand the asset pack the way you want. The other is that it is normally a creative limitation, sometimes this is good since you want to do something super related with those assets, and sometimes it is really bad since you can't move outside those bounds. 

#### Hire artists

Didn't try hiring an artist, the reason was, if I have to hire an artist, I want to be pretty sure about the game I am doing. So is something I could try in the future. But one thing I wanted to try was to hire different artists for specific tasks to start knowing them and experiment the workflow, etc, but I had no money to spend on that once I decided that could've been a good move.

#### Find teammate/partner

Tried to work with two friends to see if I find a partner there but with no luck, both experiments were pretty unsuccessful, it wasn't the right time to work together I suppose or my expectations were pretty high. I am talking with new people (juan and penusbmic, artists) and at some point I want to experiment doing a small thing together, maybe I can find partnership there. I also was in contact with Calix Jumio (dev in general) a lot, we normally share stuff and discuss, I feel pretty comfortable talking with him but we never had a chance to do something together either. 

#### Find my own style

I found a simple style with lowres low color palette games that I like and I can control/hack pretty well and I believe this is something that will allow me to prototype more and even grow at some point, so I feel pretty successful here.

MY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

As always, thanks for my friends Rubén and Juan Andrés Nin for being there all the time discussing how to survive in the industry.

Others

* met new friends 
* 

but I was on my own, I didn't have a team but also in some way I wanted to be able to work with other devs without the need to become a Company.
