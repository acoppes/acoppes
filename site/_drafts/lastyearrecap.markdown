## Intro

When I started this journey of making my own games, I evaluated my situation and then defined some objectives to achieve and pillars to have in mind all the time.

I was super inspired by [Sokpop Collective](https://sokpop.itch.io/) and [PUNKCAKE Délicieux](https://punkcake.itch.io/) (among others) who develop small games super fast and I wanted to achieve something similar at some point. 

So my pillars were:

* **Long term growth**: each time I work on something, it has to have some value for me in the future or I should modify the premise to have some value for me in the future. 
* **Tools and workflows**: create and improve tools and workflows all the time to reduce non creative time. 
* **Overcome weakness**: train, improve, find different ways to attack my weakness or and sometimes avoid them and just focus on my strengths. 
* **Start small / Mini games**: don't make an MMO, attack things I can control both in content and scope.

And my objectives were:

* **Find a game to work on**: my idea was to participate in many game jams as possible to try different things and find something interesting, while developing new tools and workflows to become faster. And also in that process, find the proper scope for my games.
* **Find a way to have art in my games**: for this issue I had like different paths in mind to explore like buying assets, hiring an artist, find a teammate/partner and even start doing the art myself.

I didn't have a clear roadmap, it was more like I want to do this or that so my actions should reflect that, and at some point I will start completing the objectives.

Ok, that was the intro, now I want to share a more detailed story of what happened in 2023. You can jump to [Conclusions](#conclusions) if you want the end of the story.

## 2023 review in detail

### Beat'em up

I've started by working on a Beat'em up with my friend [Franco Zucchi](https://twitter.com/pencilwing). I was super excited with this one, really wanted to learn from this genre while also doing something together. It was a ninja game really inspired by Naruto. I decided to use the TMNT assets to start prototyping and Franco did the main character concepts and some placeholder animations to work with.

</div>

In the end I quickly found out that it wasn't the time to do something together but instead of cancelling the project I decided to continue it by switching to buy assets and see what I can do. I knew this genre is not so strong in terms of how much money they generate but I continued its development as a learning process.

I iterated a lot, with different assets packs, and at some point I even started buying some, these are different versions of the same game:

</div>

After those iterations, it ended up looking something like this:

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/assets/2023review/beatemup-gameplay3.gif" />
</div>

The main reason was that I was reducing assets resolution and complexity to see if it was something I could modify if I had to, or if I had to hire someone it should be easier for them too, compared to the initial version.

During this process I found [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) and his assets pack and I fell in love with the art style and how he animates. One thing I realized was that, even with low res asset packs I found myself limited pretty fast when I wanted to try something new and I didn't feel comfortable with modifying the assets for my needs (yet?).

After spending lots of time in this game, I wasn't so sure how to stop working on it, I mean, I knew this was a learning process but it was becoming a project more and more, I was thinking lots of ideas I wanted to test, but I believed this wasn't the right project. Thankfully, a Ludumdare was coming and that was the proper excuse to stop thinking in this game and do something different to clear my mind.

### Spice Must Flow

It was [Ludum dare 52](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52) and the theme was: Harvest. I did a game about Dune Harvesters and the Sand Worm, [here is a blog post](/2023/01/12/ludumdare52jam) about it.

<div class="post-image">

</div>

It was super fun to make and I had the chance to make something different, a low poly 3d game with vehicle driving mechanics. 

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/spice-must-flow)

Participating in this game jam refreshed me and helped to decide do abandon the Beat'em up and go back to make mini games and/or prototypes to try to find something interesting I want to, and I can, finish to the end. I decided to start making my own "game jams", where I had to make a game in one or two weeks, and let my spice flow....

### Stranded: planet survivor

This was a survivor game like Don't starve but Sci-fi, and was heavily inspired by Penusbmic Stranded asset pack. The story was that you are one of those guys that go to explore a planet in FTL and never return, so you are now alone in an unknown planet and you have to find a way to fix your ship and return to your crew.

<div class="post-image">

</div>

After one or two weeks of development, I only had some world generation but there was no real game, only exploration, it was fun to make but I trying to do all the ideas I had for that game in two weeks was impossible for me.

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/survivorgame)

*A glitch in the matrix: At some point in the future (don't remember exactly when), and inspired by other developers, I experimented mixing low poly cellshaded 3d with pixel art billboards thinking in better world generation for the game, here is a video of that:*

<span>I really love how this looks too, but didn't explore more, maybe something for the future</span> 
</div>

### Hunter games

My next mini game was Hunter Games. You play a hunter competing for your tribe and you have to hunt as many creeps as possible.  

<div class="post-image">

</div>

I wasn't looking for something new with this minigame, just wanted to complete a mini experience and have a game loop, even though it was pretty simple, but compared with the previous game which has no game loop at all. I was super happy with its result and it was the core for other prototypes and mini experiences I did later.

[Play the game](https://arielsan.itch.io/huntersgame)

*Fun Fact: while writing this blogpost I though this game was released mid 2023 but when I checked out I released it around [Feb 13](https://twitter.com/arielsan/status/1625207607295188992)*

### Super dino box

At this point I was already [working on an app for some friends and also teaching in University](2023/03/04/update-current-plan.html) but I also wanted to be 100% focused on games at some point. For that reason, I thought about having a lateral income related with games, maybe mobile or web games. 

A friend of mine was developing games for [Poki](https://poki.com/) at that time and recommended it so I decided to see if I can publish something, and since I had two other friends (Matías Sniadower and Enzo Gaiero) that were interested in experimenting this too, we decided to do something together. I was super excited to do something together since we were a core game dev team: an artist, a game designer and a programmer, and if this worked we could start having like a team to do more stuff in the future.

After analyzing other games and also based on our interests, we decided to make a game like a Super Crate Box but with Dinosaurs, and it should take around one month of work.

<span>Super early prototype and super the last version of the game because we abandoned it at that time xD</span>
</div>

After a week of work we concluded it was going to take longer that we wanted to spend so we aborted the idea. However, we were still interested in trying to do something for that web portal at some point in the future.

### Endless Runner -> Gorilla Jones

Even though we abandoned that Super Crate Box idea, I kept working on a [platformer mechanics as a learning process](2023/04/10/platformer_techniques_in_endless_runner.html) and that evolved into an endless runner using one of Penusbmic assets pack:

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/assets/endlessrunner-gameplay-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
</div>

As I said before, we were still interested in publishing a game in Poki and thought that maybe an Endless Runner could be easy to do and a fit for the platform. So together with Matías Sniadower we decided to continue this project and change the assets and see what happens.

The game evolved to be Gorilla Jones:

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/assets/2023review/gorilla-teaser-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
</div>

During its development, we started interacting with Poki and had like 3 iterations but in the end they weren't interested in the game, it wasn't clear if they didn't like the genre or they were avoiding Unity games but we decided to not spend more time on it anyways. 

We published the game for free on itch, you can [play it here](https://arielsan.itch.io/gorillajones)

Working on this game was a good experiment that should've failed fast but it didn't (or I didn't want to abort it again) it that was a big mistake.

Some conclusions:

* Game wasn't published in Poki so we have no idea if that is a good platform or not and we don't know how to publish a game there.
* I didn't have a great experience working together with Matías since he had his focus on other things so it felt like I was doing the game alone all the time. I don't blame him at all, it was my mistake, I put big expectations but we never talked about that before we started working so in the end I suffered that.
* We spent a lot of time (~4 months, part time) in something that didn't add a lot of value, and something we said it should've been completed in 1 month.
* I learned more about procedural generation and also a bit of game design.

During some gaps in its development (like waiting for poki or waiting for assets) I decided to keep doing mini games/experiences jams.

### Mini RTS experience

With the assets, and part of the logic, of Hunter games, I created a mini RTS experience focused on micromanagement. I really love the genre and from time to time come back to try to develop something RTS alike.

</div>

Again, with this game I also focused on having a game loop (win and lose). I obviously had more ideas in mind I couldn't add in time but I am pretty happy with the result.

### Abduction 101

[lowrezjam2023](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023)

Started exploring art styles I had some control over it, made a fun toy to play with, but still not finding a game and not exploring the GAME part so much.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/jams-lowrezjam-2023-01.gif" />
</div>

### A failed GBJAM and Neko platformer

More art style exploration, two prototypes here, the "there is no room in space" and "nekoplatformer"

### A successful 1bit jam I never participated - Ship miner

Found an art style I like and control, people are interested. 
Found a game I like to play while developing and people seem interested in that too.

## Conclusion

About the objectives I defined when started, here are the conclusions about them for 2023. 

### Find a game

I experimented with different games in terms of genres, a bit with different art styles

Improved my tools and workflows while doing different games too.

### Find an art style

#### Buy assets

Tried buying assets, it worked pretty well as starting point, there are a lot of assets packs out there, I super recommend @penusbmic ones (but probably because I love pixel art). But using assets has some issues. One is, when you try to expand, you need an artist or pay or convince the original artist to expand the asset pack the way you want. The other is that it is normally a creative limitation, sometimes this is good since you want to do something super related with those assets, and sometimes it is really bad since you can't move outside those bounds. 

#### Hire artists

Didn't try hiring an artist, the reason was, if I have to hire an artist, I want to be pretty sure about the game I am doing. So is something I could try in the future. But one thing I wanted to try was to hire different artists for specific tasks to start knowing them and experiment the workflow, etc, but I had no money to spend on that once I decided that could've been a good move.

#### Find teammate/partner

Tried to work with two friends to see if I find a partner there but with no luck, both experiments were pretty unsuccessful, it wasn't the right time to work together I suppose or my expectations were pretty high. I am talking with new people (juan and penusbmic, artists) and at some point I want to experiment doing a small thing together, maybe I can find partnership there. I also was in contact with Calix Jumio (dev in general) a lot, we normally share stuff and discuss, I feel pretty comfortable talking with him but we never had a chance to do something together either. 

#### Find my own style

I found a simple style with lowres low color palette games that I like and I can control/hack pretty well and I believe this is something that will allow me to prototype more and even grow at some point, so I feel pretty successful here.

WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW

MY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

As always, thanks for my friends Rubén and Juan Andrés Nin for being there all the time discussing how to survive in the industry.

Others

* met new friends 
* 

but I was on my own, I didn't have a team but also in some way I wanted to be able to work with other devs without the need to become a Company.
