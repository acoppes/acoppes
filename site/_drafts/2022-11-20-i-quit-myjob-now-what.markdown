excerpt: Want to share a bit of my status right now and my current plan for the future now that I left my work after almost ten years.

Leaving the company I invested the last ten years of my life was a really hard decision to make but at the same time I feel it was the right move, Ironhide Game Studio was growing to fast and too much and even I don't disagree with that vision of big company I didn't want that for me. I still love the people and every game we did there and wish for them to keep making awesome games, I will always be a fan.

I still don't know what I'm going to do next, I didn't have a plan before leaving like another job offering nor a part time project but even though I know it wasn't a smart move, I needed it.  

My plan for now is to practice and learn a lot about different kind of games I don't have experience while making small games and experimenting a bit at the same time.  

Right now I am prototyping a Beat'em up of Ninjas (Naruto-like) with my friend [@pencilwing](https://pencilwing.itch.io/), with influence from the last [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361510/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Shredders_Revenge/) game. In my case to learn techniques like Input Buffering and Hit boxes and in the case of @pencilwing to practice high res animation in Pixelart. We both want to improve our game design skills too by experimenting and discussing ideas for the prototype.

For now I am running on savings and I will try to do some freelance work or consultancy focusing first on game development but could be anything else. Also, my awesome wife is supporting me in this journey both in a psychological and economic way.

While practicing and learning, I hope to find something interesting that I would want to continue developing, maybe try to get some funding and then publish. 

Wish me luck.
