End of year is coming and it is a good time to do a recap of what happened this year and write of what I expect for the next year.

# What happened in 2025

## Personal

In personal terms, it was a difficult year, my dad passed away in July and it was super unexpected for all the family, and super hard to process. We loved him so much and we are missing him a lot.

## Cleared Hot

This was a super interesting year for Cleared Hot, we managed to release an awesome [Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/497197576207992686) around June, just in time for a Steam Next Fest. We worked hard to get it in time so when players reacted so well to the demo, we felt it paid off. 

But then, a month ago, we released the game in [Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/621061805456752828) with the first chapter of the story. We worked even harder to get this one in proper shape and in time but the good thing is that it was received even better than the Demo. We couldn't be more prouder of the game and the work we did, thank you so much!!. Realeasing a game is hard and takes time and having this great reception is a great relief.

Here is the link of the game:

What is this game for me, well, I started working on in a consultancy mode, just providing some 

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

My plan for the year was to release a public Demo of Ship Miner and also to maybe release the game in Early Access.

Well, after the initial [plan to have a demo](/2025/03/29/shipminer-roadmap-to-demo)

In terms of other projects and jams, this year I took that easy and only decided to participate in the [GBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13). The theme for this year was Luck and we made a game named Faster than Luck with my friend [Unf0ld](https://www.instagram.com/unf0ldmusic/?hl=en).

In general terms, I also wanted to prototype some new ideas for a possible next game but that didn't happen after the hard work on the two projects and also personal stuff.

# What's up for 2026

For the next year the idea is to work hard on both projects again, we need to get Cleared Hot ready for full release and I hope I can get out Ship Miner even in Early Access, maybe for around July. 

I also want to start getting more time to work on some prototypes and jams again just for fun and improvement. I also want to start searching for a next project and maybe participating in jams can help, but in any case it is obvious that this depends a lot on how I am doing with the rest of the stuff.
