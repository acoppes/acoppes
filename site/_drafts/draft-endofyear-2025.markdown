End of year is coming and it is a good time to do a recap of what happened this year and write of what I expect for the next year, [as I did the last year](/2025/01/12/recap-2024-and-2025-plans).

# What happened in 2025

## Personal

In personal terms, it was a difficult year, my dad passed away, he got a respiratory infection in July and even he was a healthy person, he couldn't recover. It was really unexpected and hard to process for all the family. We loved him so much and we are missing him a lot. Then, a month ago, my grandma also passed away. Even though her case was a bit different, since she was mentally ill for a long time and she was really old, it wasn't easy to process. I don't need to enter in more detail but we are still processing it.

Those two events changed the dynamics of the family, for example I started helping my mom with different things. That affected my work but since I have flexibility I can gradually adjust working hours of each project while things happen, and adjust back once they go back to less not normal.

## Cleared Hot

This was a super interesting year for Cleared Hot, we managed to release an awesome [Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/497197576207992686) around June, just in time for a Steam Next Fest. We worked hard to get it in time so when players reacted so well to the demo, we felt it paid off. 

But then, a month ago, we released the game in [Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/621061805456752828) with the first chapter of the story. We worked even harder to get this one in proper shape and in time but the good thing is that it was received even better than the Demo. We couldn't be more prouder of the game and the work we did, thank you so much!!. Releasing a game is hard and takes time and having this great reception is a great relief.

NEW GIF OF THE GAME

Here is the link of the game:

When I started working in Cleared Hot, my job was more like a consultant for the general solution of the game and/or specific code stuff. However, over time it changed to be more and more of a general developer, from discussing high level game stuff to deciding the technical solutions and coding too. We grew over time and now we have a solid team of super talented people.

I am enjoying the process, from the initial moments to right now, from the technical challenge side to the human one. I was very lucky Nacho from [Sarnayer]((https://x.com/sarnayer)) put me in contact with Colin. By the way, he is in the credits as:

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

My plan for the year was to release a public Demo of Ship Miner and also to maybe release the game in Early Access.

Well, after the initial [plan to have a demo](/2025/03/29/shipminer-roadmap-to-demo)

In terms of other projects and jams, this year I took that easy and only decided to participate in the [GBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13). The theme for this year was Luck and we made a game named Faster than Luck with my friend [Unf0ld](https://www.instagram.com/unf0ldmusic/?hl=en).

</div>

In general terms, I also wanted to prototype some new ideas for a possible next game but that didn't happen after the hard work on the two projects and also personal stuff.

Even though I didn't start Ship Miner to make my dad proud or something like that, I for sure wanted him to watch me doing it and releasing it to the world. He was one of the main reasons I decided to make games in the first place. I really hope he is somewhere out there, watching.

# What's up for 2026

For the next year the idea is to work hard on both projects again, we need to get Cleared Hot ready for full release and I hope I can get out Ship Miner even in Early Access, maybe for around July. 

I also want to start getting more time to work on some prototypes and jams again just for fun and improvement. I also want to start searching for a next project and maybe participating in jams can help, but in any case it is obvious that this depends a lot on how I am doing with the rest of the stuff.
