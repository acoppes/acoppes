End of year is coming and it is a good time to do a recap of what happened this year and write of what I expect for the next year, [as I did the last year](/2025/01/12/recap-2024-and-2025-plans).

# What happened in 2025

## Personal

This was a difficult year since my dad passed away. He caught a respiratory infection around July and even thought he was a healthy person, he couldn't recover from it. We didn't expect this to happen and it was hard to process for all the family and friends. He was really loved by everyone and we are going to miss him a lot. I randomly cry when doing things (writing about this makes me cry too :sob:), I think about him but also about life and death, and about my children and how I want to be there for them.

That wasn't all, a month ago my grandma also passed away. Even though her case was a bit different, since she was mentally ill for a long time and she was really old, it was really sad as well.

Those two events changed the dynamics of the family, included my work. One good thing is I have flexibility so I was able to adjust the hours I spend on each project to be there for family (mainly for my mom), and now things are returning to "normal", I can adjust back.

## Cleared Hot

This was a super interesting year for Cleared Hot. We released the [Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/497197576207992686) around June, just in time for Steam Next Fest, and it was really well received by players, wishlists increased a lot and, even though it was a great effort to get it in time and we were a bit tired, it was a great motivational push to work forward for the next big milestone. 

Then, a month ago, we released the game in [Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/621061805456752828) with the first chapter of the story. We worked really hard for this one and it was received even better than the Demo. We couldn't be more happy with the results. Releasing a game is hard and takes time so having a great reception is relieving.

When I started working in Cleared Hot, my job was more like a consultant for the general solution of the game and/or specific code stuff. However, over time it changed to be more and more of a general developer, from discussing high level game stuff to deciding the technical solutions and coding too. The team grew up over time and now we have a solid core of super talented people, each one with a super power (my superpower is to cleanup the project including code, prefabs, scenes, plugins and my commits remove stuff that what I add xD).

We integrated my [GameObject Triggers' Logic](https://github.com/acoppes/unity-gemserk-utilities/tree/main/Packages/com.gemserk.triggers) into the project and we are using it to create the logic for the levels and I am really happy with that (btw, I am using the same core system in Ship Miner) since it proves again and again it is ready for games (I used a similar solution for Iron Marines 1 and Iron Marines 2 while in Ironhide).

Even though we work together in most of the technical solutions, I was responsible of the destruction system of the game where models are destroyed by physics interactions _(I could write in detail about this system in another blog post)_. All the destructible models are created by [Mane](https://www.artstation.com/m4ndrill) and we worked together in tools so he can also integrate and test them in the game too.

I am enjoying the process, from the moment I started to right now, from the technical challenge to the human interactions. I was very lucky that Ignacio from [Sarnayer]((https://x.com/sarnayer)) put me and Colin in contact two years ago :beers:. By the way, he is in the credits with a special role as the one who connected us :satisfied:.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

In terms of my game Ship Miner, I released a Demo in , my plan for the year was to release a public Demo of Ship Miner, which I did, and also try to release in Early Access, which I didn't.

While [planning for the Demo](/2025/03/29/shipminer-roadmap-to-demo) I knew I had to work on defining some important parts of the game, so I focused first on that. While working on that, I changed my mind a bit and instead of rushing the Demo I started a private Playtest in Steam. That allowed me to start getting feedback more gradually and prepare a better Demo.

I was surprised with how many people subscribed to the private playtest. As I continued working on the game, week by week, I started to give access to more playtesters over time and to receive more feedback from them. That was awesome and I really appreciate the time they spent on the game.

However, the general marketing advice for small indies is to have a Demo as soon as possible, and while you continue working on the game, improve the Demo too. So, after multiple iterations with the playtest version I decided publish the [Ship Miner Demo](/2025/09/19/demo-announcement-and-whatsnext.html) since the core game experience was ready to be shared with the world. I knew there were some big pieces of the game missing but still believe there was something interesting to share. Bte, I continue using the private playtest with game updates too.

A year ago the game had around 1.3k wishlists and now the game has around 3k. Some key moments were when I had the first [Threads "hit" post](https://www.threads.com/@ariel_coppes/post/DG9QtsgRdqk), starting the private Playtest and then the Demo. I didn't participate in any Steam Next Fest yet, I am saving that for when I am close to the release.

I am currently working on a mid loop of the game where the player decides where to go next after completing one asteroid, hope to get an update soon.

In terms of other projects and jams, this year I took that easy and only decided to participate in the [GBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13). The theme for this year was Luck and we made a game named Faster than Luck with my friend [Unf0ld](https://www.instagram.com/unf0ldmusic/?hl=en).

I also did a couple of updates to the demo we have with [@penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) for his assets but I didn't have the time I wanted to keep it up to date with the latest additions to the asset pack.

</div>

In general terms, I also wanted to prototype some new ideas for a possible next game but that didn't happen mainly because Ship Miner is still far from over and didn't make much sense to start something new and to keep the focus on one game.

Even though I didn't start Ship Miner to make my dad proud or something like that, I wanted him to watch me doing it and releasing it to the world since he was one of the main reasons I decided to make games in the first place. I really hope he is somewhere out there, watching.

# What's up for 2026

For the next year the idea is to work hard on both projects again, the idea is to get Cleared Hot ready for full release (that means a lot of content) and I hope I can get out Ship Miner at least in Early Access this year. 

Another idea is too try to get more time to work on some prototypes and jams again just for fun, improvement and learning, and maybe get some ideas for my next project while doing so.

I also would love to go to a gamedev conference outside my country this year.

That's it for now, no big plans for 2026 more than just continue with what I am doing.

Thanks for reading, I wish you all a great new year.
