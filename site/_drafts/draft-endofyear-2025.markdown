End of year is coming and it is a good time to do a recap of what happened this year and write of what I expect for the next year, [as I did the last year](/2025/01/12/recap-2024-and-2025-plans).

# What happened in 2025

## Personal

In personal terms, it was a difficult year, my dad passed away, he got a respiratory infection in July and even he was a healthy person, he couldn't recover. It was really unexpected and hard to process for all the family. We loved him so much and we are missing him a lot. Then, a month ago, my grandma also passed away. Even though her case was a bit different, since she was mentally ill for a long time and she was really old, it wasn't easy to process. I don't need to enter in more detail but we are still processing it.

Those two events changed the dynamics of the family, for example I started helping my mom with different things. That affected my work but since I have flexibility I can gradually adjust working hours of each project while things happen, and adjust back once they go back to less not normal.

## Cleared Hot

This was a super interesting year for Cleared Hot, we managed to release an awesome [Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/497197576207992686) around June, just in time for Steam Next Fest. We worked hard on that one and when players reacted so well, we felt the effort paid off. 

Then, a month ago, we released the game in [Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1710820/view/621061805456752828) with the first chapter of the story. We worked even harder to get the game in proper shape, and do it in time, but this one was received even better than the Demo. We couldn't be more happy with the results. Releasing a game is hard and takes time so having a great reception is relieving.

When I started working in Cleared Hot, my job was more like a consultant for the general solution of the game and/or specific code stuff. However, over time it changed to be more and more of a general developer, from discussing high level game stuff to deciding the technical solutions and coding too. The team grew up over time and now we have a solid core of super talented people. 

I am enjoying the process, from the initial moments to right now, from the technical challenge to the human interactions. I was very lucky that Ignacio from [Sarnayer]((https://x.com/sarnayer)) put me in and Colin in contact two years ago. By the way, he is in the credits with a special role as the one who connected us xD.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

In terms of my game, my plan for the year was to release a public Demo of Ship Miner, which I did, and also try to release in Early Access, which I didn't.

While [planning for the Demo]((/2025/03/29/shipminer-roadmap-to-demo)) I knew I had to work on defining some important parts of the game, so I focused first on that. While working on that, I changed my mind a bit and instead of rushing the Demo I started a private Playtest in Steam. That allowed me to start getting feedback more gradually and prepare a better Demo.

I was surprised with how many people subscribed to the private playtest. As I continued working on the game, week by week, I started to give access to more playtesters over time and to receive more feedback from them. That was awesome and I really appreciate the time they spent on the game.

However, the general marketing advice for small indies is to have a Demo as soon as possible, and while you continue working on the game, improve the Demo too. So, after multiple iterations with the playtest version I decided publish the [Ship Miner Demo](/2025/09/19/demo-announcement-and-whatsnext.html) since the core game experience was ready to be shared with the world. I knew there were some big pieces of the game missing but still believe there was something interesting to share. Bte, I continue using the private playtest with game updates too.

Right now I am working on a mid loop of the game where the player decides where to go next after completing one asteroid, hope to get an update soon.

This is Ship Miner:

In terms of other projects and jams, this year I took that easy and only decided to participate in the [GBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13). The theme for this year was Luck and we made a game named Faster than Luck with my friend [Unf0ld](https://www.instagram.com/unf0ldmusic/?hl=en).

I also did a couple of updates to the demo we have with [@penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) for his assets but I didn't have the time I wanted to keep it up to date with the latest additions to the asset pack.

In general terms, I also wanted to prototype some new ideas for a possible next game but that didn't happen mainly because Ship Miner is still far from over and didn't make much sense to start something new and to keep the focus on one game.

Even though I didn't start Ship Miner to make my dad proud or something like that, I wanted him to watch me doing it and releasing it to the world since he was one of the main reasons I decided to make games in the first place. I really hope he is somewhere out there, watching.

# What's up for 2026

For the next year the idea is to work hard on both projects again, the idea is to get Cleared Hot ready for full release (that means a lot of content) and I hope I can get out Ship Miner at least in Early Access this year. 

Another idea is too try to get more time to work on some prototypes and jams again just for fun, improvement and learning, and maybe get some ideas for my next project while doing so.

I also would love to go to a gamedev conference outside my country this year.

That's it for now, no big plans for 2026 more than just continue with what I am doing.

Thanks for reading, I wish you all a great new year.
