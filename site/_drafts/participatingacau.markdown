The [Uruguay Cinema and Audiovisual Agency](https://www.acau.gub.uy) (ACAU) organized a competitive grant for videogames development as part of the [Uruguay Audiovisual Program](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/programa-uruguay-audiovisual) (PUA) and I was invited to join the jury to evaluate and select the projects getting it. This was my first time doing this kind of job and it was pretty interesting. 

ACAU is mainly focused on cinema and audiovisual content, so the grants are mainly for that type of content. This year a videogames development exclusive grant was included as well, and the total to grant per project was around 10k USD. There was a total of 6 slots for projects (60k USD in total), from where, by the rules, one of them should be filled by a project leaded by a woman, one for a project that is the first game of the company and one for a project that is created outside the capital city.

There were 17 projects (for the Uruguayan gamedev comunity, that is a lot) and most of them were really good. It was noticeable at first sight the ones that presented for the first time versus the ones that already had experience publishing a game, presenting to other grants or even pitching to publishers. Having those extra rules help to balance the results to give opportunities to new developers, otherwise the experienced ones have lot of advantage.

The guidelines weren't so clear in what to say or not, so each participant application was really different and that made it a bit harder to evaluate since it was difficult to match them with the information provided. Some of them provided more about the company than the game, some others more about the game design than the pitch, etc. There were no specific guidelines in how or what to evaluate either, just a high level contest rules, so even the jury members didn't necessarily follow the same approach evaluating. 

The process we followed was to evaluate each jury member on its own, and once we have analyzed and evaluated each project, we had a remote meeting (we are from different countries) to compare and decide the final selection. For some project it was more direct, we were already super aligned, for others we discussed a bit but the contest rules helped us.

You can check [here in ACAU](https://www.acau.gub.uy/innovaportal/v/353/1/acau/ya-estan-disponibles-los-resultados-de-la-convocatoria-para-desarrollo-de-videojuegos-2024.html) to see the results of this grant with the list of selected projects.

I really liked the opportunity and the process, it was something different to what I normally do. I felt like I was doing the "Publisher" role for a bit, even though I couldn't discard projects by just reading an email xD, and it wasn't my money either (at least not directly, it was from all Uruguayans).

My advice to developers when presenting for future game development grants is to treat the application as similar to pitching the game to a publisher as possible and to read the rules. The jury has to make a decision based on high level information like your team, your previous experience, etc, don't focus too much on the low level like specific game mechanics or content like enemies, etc, it could help a bit but only if you communicated the high level picture as best as possible. 

From my point of view, one example is that the team is super important, so for projects that the team is the first time they do something together I need to see if they at least have great experience working in other teams, or compensate with great technical knowledge, otherwise it becomes more difficult see the viability (not saying it is not viable but less likely when compared to others).

And for ACAU itself, it would be great to include more guidelines to help the teams to focus on the main information needed to evaluate and less on other things that are not bad to have but could be more optional, mainly for those teams applying for the first time.

My personal take in general is that the grant is great, I am pretty happy they do it and that people present their projects, but also I feel like a total of 60k USD is pretty low in general, more if you consider how the videogames industry grew proportionally in the entertainment category in the past 10 years and how much money they do in general, it feels like we are like really behind when helping the industry. 

I wish the best for the selected projects and for all the others as well, I really hope they can continue and publish their games.

Thanks for reading!
