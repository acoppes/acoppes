The [Uruguay Cinema and Audiovisual Agency](https://www.acau.gub.uy) (ACAU) organized a competitive grant for videogames development as part of the [Uruguay Audiovisual Program](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/programa-uruguay-audiovisual) (PUA) and I was invited to be part of the evaluation committee. This was my first time doing this kind of job and it sounded pretty interesting so I accepted. The committee was composed by [Francesca Esquenazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-esquenazi/), [Camila Gormaz](https://bsky.app/profile/burasto.bsky.social) and [me](https://arielcoppes.dev).

ACAU is mainly focused on cinema and audiovisual content and normally the grants too. This year a videogames development exclusive grant was included and the total **per project** was around **10k USD**. There were a total of 6 slots for projects, from where, by the rules, one of them should be a project leaded by a woman, one should be a project that is the first game of the company and one should be a project of a company located outside the capital city.

There were a total of 17 projects. Considering it was the first time for this grant and also that the Uruguayan game dev community is small, it was a good number of projects. 

Each applicant had to present four different documents: dossier, distribution strategy, development plan and budget. In those documents they had to put all the information needed for the evaluation. They could include more documents if they wanted to. 

The guidelines weren't so clear in what to say or not, so each application was really different and that made the evaluation harder since it was difficult to compare the information provided. Some of them said more about the company than the game, some others more about the game design than the pitch, etc. 

By taking a quick look to all the projects, it was clear the ones that presented for the first time versus the ones that already had experience with other grants, pitching games to publishers or releasing games. In general, having the rules mentioned before help in balancing the results to give opportunities to new developers, otherwise the experienced ones would always take the lead.

There were no specific guidelines in how or what to evaluate either, just a high level contest rules, so even the committee members didn't necessarily follow the same approach when evaluating. 

The process we followed was to make our evaluations separately, and once that was done, we had a meeting to compare and decide the final selection. For some project it was more direct since we were pretty aligned and for others we discussed a bit more but the contest rules helped us.

You can check [here in ACAU](https://www.acau.gub.uy/innovaportal/v/353/1/acau/ya-estan-disponibles-los-resultados-de-la-convocatoria-para-desarrollo-de-videojuegos-2024.html) to see the results of this grant with the list of selected projects.

I really liked having this opportunity since it was something different to what I normally do. In some way it was like doing the role of a "Publisher" (even though I couldn't discard projects by just reading an email xD) and that gave me a lot of insight for the future if I decide to present my own projects for grants or to publishers.

My advice to developers when presenting for future grants is to treat the application as similar to [pitching the game to a publisher](https://ltpf.ramiismail.com/pitching-in/) as possible. The committee has to make a decision based on high level information like your team, your previous experience, etc, don't focus too much on the low level like specific game mechanics or content like enemies, etc, you can add that as optional documents if you want to but don't expect that to make the difference. 

When evaluating some of the applicants only explained how they will use the grant in the budget document but not how much they need for the complete project. I understand you might be just starting the development but having a rough estimate of the total budget helps us a lot having a better picture of the project.

As another example, when evaluating viability, I consider the team a really important point. A group of people already working together for some time (maybe in different projects), with experience in game dev, etc, generates me a lot of confidence than others. If you don't have that, try to compensate with something like great technical knowledge in some aspect, or maybe hiring someone with experience (put that in the budget as well), etc.

One feedback for ACAU would be to try to have more specific guidelines to help the new teams to focus on the important information and less on other things, something like Rami's [pitch deck template](https://ltpf.ramiismail.com/pitch-template/) would help a lot.

My personal take in general is that is awesome to have grants like this one and for people to participate in them. However, I also feel like a total of **60k USD** is pretty low for the videogames industry, more if you consider how it grows year by year. It feels like it is a small help so you can start your project and get in touch with publishers or maybe get another grant, to get more money. Maybe there should be more categories (or different grants) depending the state of the project.

Another nice to have is to share something about the selected projects (and maybe the others too), now when you read the final list you only see their names and applicant and that's all. For someone outside the process, you know nothing about them and why they were selected and that plays  against having good transparency, which I believe you must have for government grants.

And finally, I believe it would be good that part of the process was to give feedback to the applicants but I understand it could be cumbersome and maybe impossible depending the number of projects. This was one of the reason I wanted to write to at least give some general feedback in this blogpost.

I wish the best for the selected projects and for all the others as well, I really hope they can continue and publish their games.

Thanks for reading!
