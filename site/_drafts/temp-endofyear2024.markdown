While during 2023 I focused on finding a project to work on and finding not one but two, In 2024 I was focused on consolidating those projects and push that forward. 

In this blog post I will share some important things that happened during 2024, considering a personal view, and my plan for 2025.

# What happened in 2024

## Personal

I don't normally write too much about personal stuff in this blog but since I am my own company, it is really difficult to separate personal from work.

One thing that happened was that we moved to our own home when on Feb 2024, and that was probably one of the most important things of the year. One of the reason is the obvious, it is completely ours and we don't have to pay for rent anymore, which helps a lot in economic terms. But the other reason is that we invested in this house on September 2022 and we hire a fast building method company named Vantem that process your house in 3 months. Well, those 3 months converted into 15 months, they went into bankruptcy in the middle and we suffered great part of the process thinking we were going to lose the money but thankfully at the end of 2023 we got the house (a lot of people didn't), and we moved in some months later.

Another thing that happened in 2024 was that I was able to consolidate Pixel Core Games, my Game Development company where I am working on my own game Ship Miner and also providing consultancy services for Cleared Hot.

And finally I was invited to use my experience in Game Development to be part of an [evaluation committee](/2024/12/22/my-personal-notes-being-in-evaluation-committee) for a government grant where I had the opportunity to evaluate interesting projects and learned a lot from that process.

## Cleared Hot

Since I started working on Cleared Hot at the end of 2023, I had the chance to be part of an awesome growth in multiple fronts. 

From the wishlists point of view, the game was about 5k wishlists when I joined the team, and we had a couple of moments that made everything explode. The first one was presenting a new trailer for the game where the game reached 45k wishlists and the second one was signing with Microprose as Publisher of the game, and presenting that with another trailer duplicated the wishlists to be around 94k right now. 

From the team point of view, [m4ndrill](https://m4ndrill.bio.link/) joined the team to take care of the art direction and [Vitor Amado](https://vitoramado.framer.website/) the audio direction. I also had the chance to recommend my friends [Rub√©n Garat](https://rgarat.dev/) and [Enzo Gaiero](https://x.com/playorbust) as Game Developer and Game Designer respectively, and thankfully both joined the team.
 
I want to give thanks to Colin and the rest of the team for letting me be part of this awesome 2024, I am really happy to be making this awesome and technically challenging game.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

For Ship Miner, I managed to get a reasonable flow of dev hours to each moth and I was able to focus 100% on Game Development.

As I mentioned before, I created Pixel Core Games which was in part needed to create a Steam Page for Ship Miner. I did that around July 2024 to start capturing interested gamers with wishlists. At the time I announced the Steam Page my friend [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) shared it on his Instagram, that and the announcement tweets got me like 500 wishlist during the first two weeks. A couple of months later I submitted the game to the Space Exploration Fest, that in total got like another 100 and finally I was able to join [a twitter's trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450) and [that got me like 300 more](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844741963360125214). Right now the game has like 1.3k wishlists.

I submitted Ship Miner to Concurso Nacional de Videojuegos (Uruguayan Game Development Contest) and got the [innovation award](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1857859473848852972).

And I applied Ship Miner for a [government grant](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/comunicacion/noticias/abrio-convocatoria-videojuegos-2024) like 3 months ago. Even though I am pretty sure I am not gonna get it (still waiting for results) it helped me in trying to make some plans and calculate possible budgets, etc. Obviously the money would've helped me a lot more xD.

Had an initial experience talking to a possible partner/publisher, but I didn't know what to ask exactly and what I need so I decided to not continue forward with it, at least not for now. The good thing is they were super cool and we are in good terms and I hope we can work together at some point in the future, for Ship Miner or something else.

And in terms of the game itself, I have an early playtest with an initial version of the game loop ready and I shared it with a couple of friends to start getting some initial feedback on experience, controls, and gameplay in general.

GAME JAMS!!

# What's up for 2025

In general terms, I plan to release Ship Miner in Early Access this year and also plan to have a new game defined (I have an idea in mind already and need to write it a bit more) to start presenting it for grants and to publishers.

## Roadmap for Ship Miner

When talking specifically on what's ahead for Ship Miner for EA, here is an oversimplified Roadmap that could be reordered over time.

### Travel to different asteroids during a run

Right now the game is all in one asteroid, I want to add deciding and traveling to different asteroids but at the same time I am not sure if the game needs it. The main idea is to pick the destination based on some information, similar to FTL, like more dangerous but high in one mineral, and also to allow me to grow in by creating different game modes like removing permanent fog reveal or having to do something different like saving another ship miner in trouble, etc.

### Upgrades 2.0

Define how they are unlocked and improved. There is a version right now where you kinda level up by mining and randomly unlock stuff but it is a temporary thing, one of the ideas in mind is to give the player some decision when unlocking, from a pool of upgrades/things to build, like each time you level up the game presents some options between unlocking a new upgrade, upgrading an upgrade you already have or unlocking a buildable, or anything else. 

### Save and exit the game

Want to define if the game should have or not savegame ingame, that means to leave the game in the middle of a run and comeback later to continue. Why? because maybe it if each asteroid mining is short enough, it could be like a commitment to enter the game and play for 5 to 10 mins. But at the same time I am a parent of two that can't play games for more than 5 mins sometimes xD, and it is cool if you can just turn off the game and come back later and just continue where you were at.

### Sound Effects 2.0

Right now the game has some basic sound effects generated by [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) or by my recording my voice and applying some filters. With Esteban (Unfold), the music composer, we are going to integrate FMOD and give him as much control as possible to improve and make more professional sound effects.

### Procedural generation 2.0

The game right now has only procedural generation on minerals and other content in the level but not the asteroid structure/layout, the idea is to work in that part generating different layouts to increase the value in exploring the asteroid.

### Metagame and Player Progression

Define how deep I want to go with metagame. I will have basic things for sure in terms of unlocking achievements and maybe information about the world but I want to define if the player is also gonna unlock stuff to help changing the game over time, like enter the game with some upgrades unlocked already or maybe changing the ship to have another configuration, etc.

### More Content & Options

This is an ongoing objective, but the game needs more content for sure in order to be released and something I will work on during all development. And also in terms of options like changing controls,

### Performance Optimizations

Even though the game looks like it is not heavy, it processes a lot of systems and will process more, so I have to work on this point during all the development too.

### Tutorial, Steamworks & Demo

Game is clear in some points but not so much in others, once I work a iterate a couple of times and define some missing points, I will create a Tutorial to help introduce the complex things of the game to new players.

And this one too but if not, it is mainly integrate with the Steamworks SDK in order to have things like cloud save and achievements, among others. 

And also think about publishing a Demo of the game that could help in getting more wishlists and prepare for the EA release.

### Multiple Languages

Last but not least, create the platform to support multiple languages and also start adding those over time, the idea is to release in EA with at least a couple of languages and grow with more languages for the final release of the game.

## To conclude

This blog post was mainly to share a bit of what happened in 2024 and the high level plan for this year. A lot will probably change but I believe the main idea will be the same.

Thanks for reading!
