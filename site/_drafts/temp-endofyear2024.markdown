While in [2023 I focused myself on finding my own game to work on](/2024/01/18/recap-2023-and-current-plan), in 2024 I focused more on transitioning to be fulltime in game dev for both [Cleared Hot and my game Ship Miner](/2024/05/31/shipminerupdate). 

In this blog post I will share what happened during 2024 and my plan for 2025.

# What happened in 2024

## Personal

One of the most important things that happened was that my wife, my kids an I moved to our own house on Feb 2024 which means we don't have to pay for rent anymore helping a lot in economic terms and we also can start making mid term plans for the family. 

But there is another hidden reason that makes it feel more important than normal and it is that we invested most of our savings hiring a fast building method company to build it and there were some issues. The process started around September 2022 and the company promised us they will have the house done in 3 months. That time converted into 15 months and even at some point they went into bankruptcy. We really suffered great part of the process thinking we were going to lose our investment but, at the end of 2023, we received the house and we moved some months later. We were really lucky, some other clients and providers were not. 

Another thing that happened in 2024 was that I was able to consolidate Pixel Core Games, my Game Development company where I am working on my own game [Ship Miner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/) and also providing consultancy and development services for [Cleared Hot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/).

And finally I was invited to use my experience in Game Development to be part of an [evaluation committee](/2024/12/22/my-personal-notes-being-in-evaluation-committee) for a government grant where I had the opportunity to evaluate interesting projects and to learn a lot from that process.

## Cleared Hot

Since I started working on Cleared Hot at the end of 2023, I had the chance to be part of an awesome growth in multiple fronts. 

From the wishlists point of view, the game was about 5k wishlists when I joined the team, and we had a couple of moments that made everything explode. The first one was presenting a new trailer for the game where the game reached 45k wishlists and the second one was signing with Microprose as Publisher of the game, and presenting that with another trailer duplicated the wishlists to be around 94k right now. 

From the team point of view, [m4ndrill](https://m4ndrill.bio.link/) joined the team to take care of the art direction and [Vitor Amado](https://vitoramado.framer.website/) the audio direction. I also had the chance to recommend my friends [Rub√©n Garat](https://rgarat.dev/) and [Enzo Gaiero](https://x.com/playorbust) as Game Developer and Game Designer respectively, and thankfully both joined the team.
 
I want to give thanks to Colin and the rest of the team for letting me be part of this awesome 2024, I am really happy to be making this interesting and technically challenging game.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

For Ship Miner, I managed to get a reasonable flow of dev hours each month and I was able to focus 100% of my time on Game Development, where 70% is for Cleared Hot and 30% for Ship Miner, more or less.  

As I mentioned before, I created Pixel Core Games which was in part needed to create a Steam Page for Ship Miner. I did that around July 2024 to start capturing interested players with wishlists. At the time I announced the Steam Page my friend [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) shared it on his Instagram, that and the announcement tweets got me like 500 wishlist during the first two weeks. A couple of months later I submitted the game to the Space Exploration Fest, that in total got like another 100 and finally I was able to join [a twitter's trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450) and [that got me like 300 more](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844741963360125214), to be currently around 1.3k wishlists in total.

At the end of the year there was a Game Development SUMMIT here in Uruguay named [LevelUY](https://www.leveluy.com/), where Concurso Nacional de Videojuegos (Uruguayan Game Development Contest) is hosted, and I decided to submit Ship Miner to it without much expectation since the game wasn't ready to compete. To my surprise, it got the [2024 Innovation Award](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1857859473848852972) and I couldn't be more happier.

In September, I applied for a [government competitive grant](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/comunicacion/noticias/abrio-convocatoria-videojuegos-2024) to help Ship Miner development. The grant is a total of around 30k and could be really important the game but normally there is a good competition in this kind of grants so I am a bit not expecting to get it.

I also had the chance of talking with a possible partner/publisher and it was a great experience, they were super cool and I also learned from that process. We didn't reach a deal but because I didn't know exactly what I need or want from a partner yet.

And in terms of the game itself, I have already an early playtest with an initial version of the game loop and I shared it with a couple of friends to start getting feedback on experience, controls and gameplay.

In spite of having being pretty busy with Ship Miner and Cleared Hot I still participated in a couple of game jams this year and I am [pretty happy and proud](/2024/10/15/why-participate-in-jams-if-i-have-a-game) with that.

# What's up for 2025

In general terms, I plan to release Ship Miner in Early Access while also have a new game defined to start prototyping and present it for grants and/or to publishers.

## Ship Miner's Roadmap

When talking specifically on what's ahead for Ship Miner to get into EA, I have a simplified Roadmap not necessarily ordered.

### Travel to different asteroids during a run

Right now the game is all in one asteroid, I want to add deciding and traveling to different asteroids but at the same time I am not sure if the game needs it. The main idea is to pick the destination based on some information, similar to FTL, like more dangerous but high in one mineral, and also to allow me to grow in by creating different game modes like removing permanent fog reveal or having to do something different like saving another ship miner in trouble, etc.

### Upgrades 2.0

Define how they are unlocked and improved. There is a version right now where you kinda level up by mining and randomly unlock stuff but it is a temporary thing, one of the ideas in mind is to give the player some decision when unlocking, from a pool of upgrades/things to build, like each time you level up the game presents some options between unlocking a new upgrade, upgrading an upgrade you already have or unlocking a buildable, or anything else. 

### Save and exit the game

Want to define if the game should have or not savegame ingame, that means to leave the game in the middle of a run and comeback later to continue. Why? because maybe it if each asteroid mining is short enough, it could be like a commitment to enter the game and play for 5 to 10 mins. But at the same time I am a parent of two that can't play games for more than 5 mins sometimes xD, and it is cool if you can just turn off the game and come back later and just continue where you were at.

### Sound Effects 2.0

Right now the game has some basic sound effects generated by [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) or by my recording my voice and applying some filters. With Esteban (Unfold), the music composer, we are going to integrate FMOD and give him as much control as possible to improve and make more professional sound effects.

### Procedural generation 2.0

The game right now has only procedural generation on minerals and other content in the level but not the asteroid structure/layout, the idea is to work in that part generating different layouts to increase the value in exploring the asteroid.

### Metagame and Player Progression

Define how deep I want to go with metagame. I will have basic things for sure in terms of unlocking achievements and maybe information about the world but I want to define if the player is also gonna unlock stuff to help changing the game over time, like enter the game with some upgrades unlocked already or maybe changing the ship to have another configuration, etc.

### More Content & Options

This is an ongoing objective, but the game needs more content for sure in order to be released and something I will work on during all development. And also in terms of options like changing controls,

### Performance Optimizations

Even though the game looks like it is not heavy, it processes a lot of systems and will process more, so I have to work on this point during all the development too.

### Tutorial, Steamworks & Demo

Game is clear in some points but not so much in others, once I work a iterate a couple of times and define some missing points, I will create a Tutorial to help introduce the complex things of the game to new players.

And this one too but if not, it is mainly integrate with the Steamworks SDK in order to have things like cloud save and achievements, among others. 

And also think about publishing a Demo of the game that could help in getting more wishlists and prepare for the EA release.

### Multiple Languages

Last but not least, create the platform to support multiple languages and also start adding those over time, the idea is to release in EA with at least a couple of languages and grow with more languages for the final release of the game.

## To conclude

This blog post was mainly to share what happened in 2024 and the plan for 2025. A lot could change but I believe the main idea will be the same.

Thanks for reading!
