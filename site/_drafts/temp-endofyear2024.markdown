While in [2023 I focused myself on finding my own game to work on](/2024/01/18/recap-2023-and-current-plan), in 2024 I focused on transitioning to be working fulltime in Game Development for both [Cleared Hot and my game Ship Miner](/2024/05/31/shipminerupdate). 

In this blog post I will share what happened during 2024 and my plan for 2025.

# What happened in 2024

## Personal

One thing that happened past year was that, with my wife and kids, we moved to our own house in Feb 2024. This was a great milestone in our lives and we don't have to pay for rent anymore. 

But a reason that makes it feel more important is that we invested our savings to build it and there were problems in the process. In September 2022 we hired a fast building method company that promised us the house done in 3 months. They were delayed by a year and even at some point they went into bankruptcy. We thought we were going to lose our investment and it wasn't pleasing. But at the end of 2023, in spite of the bad process and communication with the company, we received the house and we couldn't be more happy. We were really lucky :pray:, some others were not so much :disappointed:.  

Another important thing that happened in the middle of 2024 was that I founded my Game Development company Pixel Core Games where provide consultancy and development services for [Cleared Hot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/) and also develop [Ship Miner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/).

And finally, at the end of the year, I was invited to provide my experience in Game Development to be part of an [evaluation committee](/2024/12/22/my-personal-notes-being-in-evaluation-committee) for a government grant where I had the opportunity to evaluate interesting projects and learn a lot by that.

## Cleared Hot

Since I started working on Cleared Hot at the end of 2023, I had the chance to be part of an awesome growth in multiple fronts. 

From the wishlists point of view, the game was about 5k wishlists when I joined the team, and we had a couple of moments that made everything explode. The first one was presenting the new trailer, that helped us getting to around 45k wishlists and the second one was when we announced a partnership with Microprose as Publisher with another custom trailer which got us to be around 94k wishlists right now. 

From the team point of view, [m4ndrill](https://m4ndrill.bio.link/) joined the team to take care of the Art Direction and [Vitor Amado](https://vitoramado.framer.website/) the Audio Direction, both super talented. I also had the chance to recommend my friends [Rub√©n Garat](https://rgarat.dev/) and [Enzo Gaiero](https://x.com/playorbust) as Game Developer and Game Designer respectively, and both joined the team.

I want to give thanks to Colin and the rest of the team for letting me have an awesome 2024, I am really happy to be working with you on an interesting and technically challenging game like Cleared Hot.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

For Ship Miner, I managed to get a reasonable flow of dev hours each month and I was able to focus 100% of my time on Game Development, where 70% is for Cleared Hot and 30% for Ship Miner, more or less.  

As I mentioned before, I created Pixel Core Games which was in part needed to create a Steam Page for Ship Miner. I did that around July 2024 to start capturing interested players through wishlists. At the time I announced the Steam Page my friend [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) shared it on his Instagram, that and the announcement tweet got like 500 wishlists in the first two weeks. A couple of months later I submitted the game to the [Space Exploration Fest](https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration), that in total got like another 100 wishlists.

Finally I was able to join [a twitter's trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450) and [that got me like 300 more](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844741963360125214), to be currently around 1.3k wishlists in total.

At the end of the year there was a Game Development SUMMIT here in Uruguay named [LevelUY](https://www.leveluy.com/), where Concurso Nacional de Videojuegos (Uruguayan Game Development Contest) is hosted, and I decided to submit Ship Miner to it without much expectation since the game wasn't ready to compete. To my surprise, it got the [2024 Innovation Award](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1857859473848852972) and I couldn't be more happier.

In September, I applied for a [government competitive grant](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/comunicacion/noticias/abrio-convocatoria-videojuegos-2024) to help Ship Miner development. The grant is a total of around 30k and could be really important the game but normally there is a good competition in this kind of grants so I am a bit not expecting to get it.

I also had the chance of talking with a possible partner/publisher and it was a great experience, they were super cool and I also learned from that process. We didn't reach a deal but because I didn't know exactly what I need or want from a partner yet.

Finally, even though I was very busy with Ship Miner and Cleared Hot, I participated in a couple of game jams and I am [pretty proud](/2024/10/15/why-participate-in-jams-if-i-have-a-game) of that.

# What's up for 2025

In general terms, I plan to release a Demo of Ship Miner and release it in Early Access (if I believe it is the best option for the game when the time comes). I also plan to define a new game to start prototyping and present it for grants and/or to publishers.

To start the new year, I shared a playable version of Ship Miner with a small group of friends to start getting feedback. Even though it is an early version and things will change, it helps me to start adjusting the experience, controls and gameplay. I will try to write a blogpost about Ship Miner's Roadmap to Demo and Early Access so I can share more where the game is right now and what's missing.

That is what happened in 2024 and my current plan for 2025.

Thanks for reading!
