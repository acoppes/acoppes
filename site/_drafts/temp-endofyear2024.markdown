While in [2023 I focused myself on finding my own game to work on](/2024/01/18/recap-2023-and-current-plan), in 2024 I focused on transitioning to be working fulltime in Game Development for both [Cleared Hot and Ship Miner](/2024/05/31/shipminerupdate). 

In this blog post I will share what happened during 2024 and my plan for 2025.

# What happened in 2024

## Personal

One thing that happened past year was that, with my wife kids, we moved to our own house in Feb 2024. This was a great milestone in our lives considering we don't have to pay for rent anymore and changed our mindset to how to improve it over time. 

But one reason that makes it feel more important is that we invested most of our savings to build it and there were some big issues in the process. In September 2022 we hired a fast building method company that promised us they will have the house done in 3 months. That time ended up being 15 months and even at some point they went into bankruptcy. We really suffered thinking we were going to lose our investment. But at the end of 2023, we received the house. We were really lucky :pray:, some others were not so much :disappointed:.  

Another important thing that happened in 2024 was that created Pixel Core Games, my Game Development company where provide consultancy and development services for [Cleared Hot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/) and also develop my own game [Ship Miner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/).

Finally, I was invited to provide my experience in Game Development to be part of an [evaluation committee](/2024/12/22/my-personal-notes-being-in-evaluation-committee) for a government grant where I had the opportunity to evaluate interesting projects and to learn a lot from that process.

## Cleared Hot

Since I started working on Cleared Hot at the end of 2023, I had the chance to be part of an awesome growth in multiple fronts. 

From the wishlists point of view, the game was about 5k wishlists when I joined the team, and we had a couple of moments that made everything explode. The first one was presenting a new trailer for the game where the game reached 45k wishlists and the second one was signing with Microprose as Publisher of the game, and presenting that with another trailer duplicated the wishlists to be around 94k right now. 

From the team point of view, [m4ndrill](https://m4ndrill.bio.link/) joined the team to take care of the art direction and [Vitor Amado](https://vitoramado.framer.website/) the audio direction. I also had the chance to recommend my friends [Rub√©n Garat](https://rgarat.dev/) and [Enzo Gaiero](https://x.com/playorbust) as Game Developer and Game Designer respectively, and thankfully both joined the team.
 
I want to give thanks to Colin and the rest of the team for letting me be part of this awesome 2024, I am really happy to be making this interesting and technically challenging game.

## Ship Miner & Pixel Core Games

For Ship Miner, I managed to get a reasonable flow of dev hours each month and I was able to focus 100% of my time on Game Development, where 70% is for Cleared Hot and 30% for Ship Miner, more or less.  

As I mentioned before, I created Pixel Core Games which was in part needed to create a Steam Page for Ship Miner. I did that around July 2024 to start capturing interested players with wishlists. At the time I announced the Steam Page my friend [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) shared it on his Instagram, that and the announcement tweets got me like 500 wishlist during the first two weeks. A couple of months later I submitted the game to the Space Exploration Fest, that in total got like another 100 and finally I was able to join [a twitter's trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450) and [that got me like 300 more](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844741963360125214), to be currently around 1.3k wishlists in total.

At the end of the year there was a Game Development SUMMIT here in Uruguay named [LevelUY](https://www.leveluy.com/), where Concurso Nacional de Videojuegos (Uruguayan Game Development Contest) is hosted, and I decided to submit Ship Miner to it without much expectation since the game wasn't ready to compete. To my surprise, it got the [2024 Innovation Award](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1857859473848852972) and I couldn't be more happier.

In September, I applied for a [government competitive grant](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-industria-energia-mineria/comunicacion/noticias/abrio-convocatoria-videojuegos-2024) to help Ship Miner development. The grant is a total of around 30k and could be really important the game but normally there is a good competition in this kind of grants so I am a bit not expecting to get it.

I also had the chance of talking with a possible partner/publisher and it was a great experience, they were super cool and I also learned from that process. We didn't reach a deal but because I didn't know exactly what I need or want from a partner yet.

In spite of having being busy with Ship Miner and Cleared Hot I still participated in a couple of game jams this year and I am [pretty happy and proud](/2024/10/15/why-participate-in-jams-if-i-have-a-game) for that.

# What's up for 2025

In general terms, during 2025 I plan to release Ship Miner in Early Access and also define a new game to start prototyping and present it for grants and/or to publishers.

To start the new year, I shared a playable version of Ship Miner with a small group of friends to start getting feedback. Even though it is an early version and things will change, it helps me to start adjusting the experience, controls and gameplay. I will try to write a blogpost or similar to talk about Ship Miner's Roadmap for Early Access.

That is what happened in 2024 and my current plan for 2025.

Thanks for reading!
