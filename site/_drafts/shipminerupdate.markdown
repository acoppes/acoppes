Until the last month I was working half of my time in [Cleared Hot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/) (btw wishlist!) and almost the other half of my time for the +Mercados mobile app for a couple of old friends. 

My plan was to start slowly reducing time on that app and spend it for my projects but in the middle of thinking that, this tweet happened:

It had a lot of positive comments where my main conclusions were that I can feel confident on the art style direction, and also that the mining core mechanic inspire good things on people, they are imagining games over it that they like. Now, I have to see if the game I end up making is the one they wanted, and if not, the like it anyways. And, that is the path ahead right now. 

But also, it helped me deciding to speed up the plan on recovering dev time. So I am targeting to be spending 25% of my time on Ship Miner 25% on +Mercados in the short term, and then move to 50/50 between Cleared Hot and Ship Miner (100% focused on games development).

In terms of Ship Miner itself, I have to continue defining stuff. Right now I have a good core mechanic and it feels really good but it just a toy and I want a game over it, and that should be my focus. 

The initial core loop in my mind was: mine, survive, improve, repeat. But right now I only have the mine (and maybe a bit of the repeat part).

So my next steps are related to complete that core loop, at least a basic version and start playtesting to get some feedback on that. I am also thinking in asking a game designer friend for paid consultancy on this topic. 

Right now I am working in some ideas for the improvement part of the core loop. 

Initially I wanted the game to be in separated steps, and a bit random, like Nuclear Throne, where you select mutations between levels, so in here you will be gathering minerals and then jump to next asteroid and in the middle you were going to buy random upgrades with your minerals. But the problem I see there is the player can't plan well how to use the gathered minerals. For example, if he doesn't have enough minerals to buy an upgrade, and then it doesn't appear anymore, it is a bit weird.

So now I am changing a bit the idea. One thing I noticed playing the game is that I like to be most of my time mining. So I am changing a bit the approach, maybe the player can improve at any time, just have to have the upgrade unlocked and research if have enough minerals. Research takes some time to complete so you can continue mining. So this would be more like in XCOM or Master of Orion where you have to wait game time to get a research completed.

How to unlock those upgrades? maybe when jumping to next asteroid could be an option. Another one, maybe more aligned with the pillar of mining and exploration is that the upgrades blueprints can be found by mining like other resources (maybe you still have to select from some random options but at least it is more integrated with the mining and discovering cycle). This is a path I want to explore.

The other thing that happened to me when thinking this was that I want the player to mine and consume minerals but upgrades sound like a definitive thing and also they should take some time to research (and probably increase time I have multiple levels of the same upgrade) and can't be so fast that it doesn't make sense to have the time resource here. So the other thing I thought was to have a way to build consumables, using time too but can be less than upgrades and probably fixed (not changing over time). Consumables can be instant effect stuff like recover some health, speed up boost, or something like that, and can also be effects that last some time like a drone that helps you mine faster or search for minerals, etc. I want the player to plan which consumables he wants but I also want him to activate it when he wants. So I need some kind of inventory to store consumables. I like that but also want to keep it as simple as possible. So I will try to test it with the less effort on visuals (in terms of UI) and see if I like it and makes sense for the game.

So yeah, that is where am I right now, exploring the improvement part. As soon as I get some insight of it, I will try to focus on the survive part which will probably be related with enemies appearing from some places and attack you, steal minerals, etc.

Thanks for reading.
