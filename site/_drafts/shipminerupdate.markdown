{{page.excerpt}}

Until last month I was working half of my time in Cleared Hot (the helicopters game) and almost the other half of my time for a javascript app named +Mercados for a couple of old friends. 

I had really little time to spend on my own projects but now I am slowly recovering it by reducing the time on the app, my idea is to target 75% of my time for Cleared Hot and 25% to myself, and this means spending time on Ship Miner, which btw, had another great tweet/post.

It had a lot of positive comments where my main conclusions were that I can feel confident on the art style, and also that the mining core mechanic inspire good things on people, they are imagining games over it that they like. Now I have to see if the game I end up making is the one they wanted and/or they like it anyways, that is the path ahead right now. And this is one of the main reasons I want to work on recovering time for the game.

So, focusing on the plan, I am spending time on Ship Miner and by that I have to continue defining stuff. Right now I have a good core mechanic, it feels super nice to play, I have a great toy but I want to have a game too. 

The initial core loop in my mind was: mine, survive, improve, repeat. But right now I only have the mine and repeat xD.

So my next steps are related to complete that core loop, at least a basic version and start playtesting to get some feedback on that. I am also thinking in hiring a game designer friend for advice on this. 

Right now I am working in some ideas for the improvement. 

Initially I wanted the game to be in separated steps, and a bit random, like Nuclear Throne, where you select mutations between levels, so in here you will be gathering minerals and then jump to next asteroid and in the middle you were going to buy random upgrades with your minerals. But the problem I see there is you can't plan at all how to use your minerals, if you didn't have enough minerals for an upgrade you wanted, and then it doesn't appear anymore, it is strange.

So now I am changing a bit the idea. One thing I noticed playing the game is that I like to be most of my time mining. So I am changing a bit the approach, maybe you can upgrade at any time, you just have to have the upgrade in your set of upgrades (maybe unlocked in each jump) and you can research it at any time if you have enough minerals. Research is going to take some time, so you have time as resource too, but the good thing is you can continue mining. 

But how to unlock those upgrades... maybe having to jump to next asteroid could be an option but maybe, to be aligned with the pillar of mining and exploration, the upgrades blueprints can be found by mining like normal minerals, you just mine mine and a new blueprint is found! Maybe you still have to select from some random options but at least it is more integrated with the mining and discovering cycle.

The other thing that happened to me when thinking this was that I want the player to mine and consume minerals, but upgrades sound like a definitive thing and also they should take some time to research (and increase over time if researching a new level of the same upgrade), can't be so fast that it doesn't make sense to use time. So the other thing I thought was to have a way to build consumables, over time too, but can be less time than upgrades and a bit more fixed. What are consumables? can be instant effect stuff like recover health, apply a boost, or something like that, and can also be effects that last some time like building a drone that helps you mine faster, or helps you getting the minerals, etc. But one issue with this is that I need some kind of inventory, so you can build stuff, store it and activate it when you want/need. I like that but also want to keep it as simple as possible (and I have visual limits).

So yeah, that is where am I right now, exploring that part of the loop, the improve part of the loop. As soon as I get some insight of it, I will try to focus on the survive part which will probably be related with enemies appearing from some places and attack you, steal minerals, etc.

Thanks for reading.
