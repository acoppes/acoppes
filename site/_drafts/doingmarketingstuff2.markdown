# Development Marketing Tools

* Dev scenes, cinematic tools, camera, etc, marketing image levels, etc.

 how I am modifying and/or doing some tools to easily do some marketing ideas, that could work more or less but still.

My approach to marketing is pretty naive and simple for now, just post videos/gifs of the game from time to time. 

## An example for the 2k wishlist post

VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS OF BEHIND THE SCENES?

One question that sometimes arises is, should I be spending all this dev time in marketing efforts? or maybe I should just switch to use that time to try to work more and use that money to pay for Ship Miner ads? I could also try to get a deal with a team and delegate marketing efforts and investment to them by sacrificing a % when the game gets released? Well, all of those options are not opposite between them so maybe I go with a combination but what I am sure is I am learning a lot by having more and better tools for marketing inside the game and I feel it is aligned with my long term investment pillar I decided when I started my company.

# Conclusions

One important conclusion is that a lot of times having luck is a big factor. So you can make a great post but if it isn't the right time, it will disappear in the aether. The opposite can happen to, you can do a shitty post and maybe it got a lot of visibility but got 0 reaction and ends up disappearing in the aether. So how do you know the post is good to keep trying. The answer is you don't know xD, and my conclusion is sometimes you have to try a couple of times if you believe in your post, and some others you are in charge of disappearing your post in the aether to not leave traces that it was really bad xD. 

Participating in other communities and building a community feels like super related with doing marketing as well but in a more indirect way.

Another important one is that, no matter how much effort I  put in this, having a good demo in steam will probably outpace by far all this small efforts, or maybe it will invalidate the game in some way.
