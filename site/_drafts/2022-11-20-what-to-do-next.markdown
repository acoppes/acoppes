excerpt: Want to share a bit of my status right now and my current plan for the future now that I left my work after almost ten years.

Leaving the company I invested the last ten years of my life was a really hard decision to make but at the same time I feel it was the right move, Ironhide Game Studio was growing to fast and too much and even I don't disagree with that vision of big company I didn't want that for me.

I still don't know what I'm going to do next, I didn't have a plan before leaving like another job offer nor a part time project and even though I know it wasn't a smart move, I needed it.  

My plan for now is to practice and learn a lot about different kind of games I don't have experience while making small games. 

Right now I am prototyping a Beat'em up of Ninjas (Naruto-like) with my friend [@pencilwing](https://pencilwing.itch.io/), with lots influence from the last [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361510/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Shredders_Revenge/). In my case with the main purpose of learning techniques like Input Buffering and Hit boxes and for @pencilwing to practice pixelart. We both want to improve other skills and knowledge by designing together this prototype.

For the money, for now run on savings and I will try to do some freelance work or consultancy maybe in some online platform and focusing first on game development but could be another thing. Also, my awesome wife is supporting me in this journey and she has a good job.

While practicing and learning, I hope to find something interesting I would want to continue developing to then, try to get some funding and then publish. 

Wish me luck.
