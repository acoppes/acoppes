{{ page.excerpt }}

It was a hard decision to make to leave the company I invested ten years of my life. But at the same time I believe it was the right move, the company was growing to fast and too much and even I don't disagree the vision of big corporation I didn't want that for me.

So, what am I going to do next? I still don't know, I don't have a plan, I didn't leave with another offer or a part time project and I know it wasn't smart but I believe I have some time to figure it out. 

But I said I wanted to share my current plan and then I said I don't have a plan. Well my plan for now is to practice and learn a lot about different kind of games I don't have experience, starting with a Beat'em up we are prototyping with a friend. And for the money, for now run on savings and wife :) and I will try to do some freelance work or consultancy maybe in some online platform and focusing first on game development but could be another thing. 

While practicing and learning, I hope to start something interesting I would want to continue developing full time, try to get some funding and then publish. 

Wish me luck.
