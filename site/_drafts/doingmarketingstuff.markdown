# Intro

I want to share part of my experience and learnings on how I am doing the marketing for Ship Miner.

My experience of doing "marketing" started while finding which game to make, before having Ship Miner. My approach at that time was to just share images and videos of what I did on Twitter/X only. 

On November 2023 I decided to also start sharing some stuff on Reddit, in particular in the PixelArt subreddit, and did my [first post of a prototype of Ship Miner](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/17p7390/i_am_a_solodev_making_a_pixelart_1bit_space/). I believe I was super lucky with it and got great feedback for a pixelart game in a subreddit dedicated to pixelart.

While that post kinda worked on Reddit, on Twitter/X wasn't so lucky and took more than a couple of tries before working, and it did while joining a [trend tweet](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069). Between Reddit and Twitter I stated to feel more secure with its marketing potential so I decided to continue the development.

After finding the visual aesthetics of the game and kinda validated its marketing potential, it felt reasonable to take advantage of that. My approach continued being similar but the objective changed from "trying to find something interesting to develop" to "try to get more visibility and get the interest of players".

# Following Twitter/X Trends

As I mentioned before, on May 2024 I decided to [join a twitter/x trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069) where the idea is you have to quote another tweet in the trend with a similar text and share something about your game. Since doing this worked pretty I decided to join more trends as they appear.

This is a list of some of the trends I joined:


* Twitter has updated their algorithm to allow users to see more posts from smaller accounts, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069)
* The indie game I am developing and the inspirations behind it, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1832173073577209932)
* Hi, Twitter! This is my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450)
* ATTENTION INDIE DEVS, show off your art style, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1905746314643833261)
* It will cost $0 to rt my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1915764389422002210)

Some of them converted better than others but it was positive in general. I didn't find so many trends in other social networks and, when I joined, they didn't work so well for me.

# Social networks

Not so long ago, when Twitter/X was "going do die" and Bluesky and Threads started to get more and more interest, I decided to create my personal accounts and started to share Ship Miner content as well. Even though it was good to start having some presence there, they were not comparable with Twitter initially. Obviously, I didn't have the same followers and had to build that but they also lacked some features like sharing GIFs. 

After some months, both Bluesky and Threads started to improve getting more features and also more users. How is Ship Miner doing now on those platforms? Well, in my case, Bluesky has no explosive potential yet, at least for me, my posts don't get new visibility while the same posts on other social networks do. In the case of Threads, I didn't have much luck initially but at [some point something changed](https://www.threads.com/@ariel_coppes/post/DG9QtsgRdqk) and now it shows some numbers similar to Twitter/X.

### Tubmlr?

I recently decided to start to interact a bit more on Tumblr too. The truth is I don't see a powerful marketing potential there but for some reason I like the community since I suppose it is more niche or something. So I don't have any marketing expectations but I will keep posting stuff. 

### Discord

Not sure if I can call it investing in marketing or in community, or maybe in both but when I participate in the gamedev servers I am, I normally use examples of my game and/or share stuff there trying always to be open and collaborative. That was always my behaviour, like I didn't need an ultimate objective to do that since I know that in the long term, being part of communities normally bring something in return.  

## What about Reddit?

What happened to Reddit? that's a question I ask myself several times. Even though the initial good reaction was on Reddit, nowadays I am posting less frequent. Why? well, mainly because the reaction to my posts didn't match my expectations after the initial successful one. I believe there are different reasons for that. 

One reason is I believe I had a good reaction the first time because it was the typical "hey I am a solo dev making this" which normally is well received while anything else that looks like "I want your wishlist" feels more like it is an ad and reddit users (me included) don't like that so much. 

Another reason that might affect was that reddit UI changed and my lowres 1bit color game is less visible on first sight when scrolling through reddit posts. 

An option to try to take more advantage of Reddit could be to switch to share more about the game development and look for interaction and feedback. That is normally more interesting to developers than players but I am in developers subreddit so it makes sense. Another option for the future is to start participating in gaming communities more to share about the game and/or start paying to have ads directly. 

# General Marketing

One conclusion after testing different type of posts is that videos and GIFs work completely better than static images. I believe that conclusion applies to almost all games but for Ship Miner the difference is more obvious, it is more difficult to understand the game by looking at a static image. 

Comparing videos and GIFs, videos worked better for me, even considering most of my videos have no audio. Why? not super sure, could be just that the video controls are better, maybe it is the video compression (load faster on mobile devices), or maybe it is just the networks promoting more the videos than the GIFs, in the case of Twitter/X there are more analytics tools for videos like showing how many people watched until certain points, while with GIFs you don't have that. It might be a combination of all of those.

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/marketing/marketing_twitter_analytics.png" />
  <span>Funnel data for videos on Twitter/X</span>
</div>

The other guess/conclusion is that the better that funnel is, the chances that video could be promoted in some way. Like, not sure if that is natural/organic or if they are doing that internally, like hey this video was reproduced completely for 90% of the people who watched it, ok, it has a greater score to show it more since they want users as engaged to the platform as possible. So, considering this, longer ambiguous videos worked worse for me than shorter to the point videos. 

Another thing to talk about is the call to action. Normally, after the post there is a reply with the link to steam and the WISHLIST NOW call to action. After doing different tests I am not super sure if it is needed or not, it is not clear for me since I had good wishlists additions from posts without the call to action and bad wishlist additions from posts with the call to action. But my current conclusion is to always try to add it anyways since you don't lose so much and it is easier for the potential players to find the link to Steam. The only downside is making super ultra clear that your initial post was to get wishlists and not just sharing something cool.

# Wishlists

This is the graph of wishlists since I created the Steam page, and some of the things I did to get those small spikes.

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/marketing/marketing_wishlists_total_marks.png" />
</div>

1. Steam page Announcement (teaser) + [penusbmic](https://penusbmic.itch.io/) shared story with link on instagram :heart:
2. Sep 2 - Steam Exploration Fest
3. Oct 9 - Hi twitter this is my game
4. Nov 9 - Happy birthday to Ship Miner
5. Jan & Feb - Just some posts and/or trends.
6. Mar & April - Shared multiple videos with audio, Threads discovered the game and started working
7. More posts and/or trends

# Conclusions

One important conclusion is that a lot of times having luck is a big factor. So you can make a great post but if it isn't the right time, it will disappear in the void. The opposite can happen to, you can do a shitty post and maybe it got a lot of visibility but got 0 reaction and ends up disappearing in the aether. So how do you know the post is good to keep trying. The answer is you don't know xD, and my conclusion is sometimes you have to try a couple of times if you believe in your post, and some others you are in charge of disappearing your post in the aether to not leave traces that it was really bad xD. 

Participating in other communities and building a community feels like super related with doing marketing as well but in a more indirect way.

Another important one is that, no matter how much effort I  put in this, having a good demo in steam will probably outpace by far all this small efforts, or maybe it will invalidate the game in some way.

I want to write another dev blog post showing some of the internal tools I did inside the game that helps me when creating marketing content like videos and GIFs.

Thanks for reading! 

WISHLIST Ship Miner!!
