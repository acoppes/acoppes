# Intro

I want to share part of my experience and learnings on how I am doing the marketing of Ship Miner.

My experience of doing marketing started before Ship Miner, while still finding which game to make. My approach at that time was simple, and it is similar to what I do nowadays, just share screenshots or videos of everything I did, mainly in Twitter/X and Mastodon at that time. 

On November 2023 I decided to also start sharing some stuff on Reddit, in particular the PixelArt subreddit, and did my [first post of a prototype of Ship Miner](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/17p7390/i_am_a_solodev_making_a_pixelart_1bit_space/). I believe I was super lucky with it and got great first impressions for a pixelart game in a subreddit dedicated to pixelart.


That helped me deciding to continue the development of Ship Miner, but getting a good reaction on Twitter/X wasn't so direct and took some time. In the end it finally started to get traction until it got a [great tweet](#following-twitterx-trends), just validating a bit more the marketing potential of the game.

After finding the visual aesthetics of the game and kinda validated that on social media, it sounded reasonable to try to take advantage of that. My approach continued being the same but now with more content of the game.

The main objective before having a game was to find something that looked interesting to others while my main objective now is get more visibility and convert that to steam wishlists.

# Following Twitter/X Trends

On May 2024 I decided to [join a twitter/x trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069) about twitter updating their algorithm so smaller accounts get more visibility, not sure if it was true or not but the idea was to quote another post and write with a video or something of your game. That worked awesome at that time and I decided to try to follow those type of trends from time to time.

This is a list of some of the trends I joined:

* The indie game I am developing and the inspirations behind it, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1832173073577209932)
* Hi, Twitter! This is my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450)
* ATTENTION INDIE DEVS, show off your art style, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1905746314643833261)
* It will cost $0 to rt my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1915764389422002210)

Some of them did better than others, but joining was free so there is nothing to lose to just do it. I didn't find so many of this kind of trends in other social networks or when they appeared didn't work so well for me.

# More social networks

Not so long ago, when Twitter/X was like "going do die" and Bluesky and Threads started to get some traction, I decided to create accounts and started to share Ship Miner content. Even though it was good to start having some presence there, if I compare them 1 to 1 to Twitter they were really bad at that time.

But these things take some time to build, get followers, etc. After some months, both Bluesky and Threads started to get better both feature wise (you couldn't share gifs at some point) and global users. Are they working better for me when doing visibility marketing? Well, in my case, Bluesky has no explosive potential yet, at least for now, all my posts behave the same while the same posts did pretty well in others. In the case of Threads, it started like I didn't exist to the world and at [some point I existed](https://www.threads.com/@ariel_coppes/post/DG9QtsgRdqk) and then it behaves similar to Twitter/X now.

Tumblr?

## What about Reddit?

What happened to Reddit? that's a question I ask myself several times. Even though the initial good reaction was on Reddit, nowadays I am not posting so much. Why? well, I tested posting more stuff and people didn't react so much. I have different conclusions about it. One of them is I believe reddit UI changed and my lowres 1bit color game is less visible on first sight when scrolling in the reddit website. Another one is I believe I had a good reaction the first time because it was the typical "hey I am a solo dev making this" which normally is well received while anything else that feels like "marketing I want your wishlist" feels like ads and reddit users (and I feel the same) don't like that so much. 

I like Reddit, but to take more advantage of it I believe I should switch to do more dev log stuff and/or more interactive stuff, explain something about the game, ask questions about what is better, or show different enemy styles visually and ask for opinions, etc. I believe those work better and are normally the ones I like to engage when reading reddit myself.  

# General Marketing

One conclusion after testing different type of posts is that videos and gifs work completely better than static images. I believe that applies to every game in general but for Ship Miner the difference was more obvious, static images don't work as well as videos. Comparing videos and gifs, videos work better for me, even considering most of my videos have no audio. Why? not sure, could be just the video controls are better, maybe it is the compression or something, or maybe it is just the networks promoting more the videos than the gifs (this is my guess), in the case of Twitter/X you have more analytics for videos, like showing how many people watched it until certain points, while with gifs you don't have that.

</div>

The other guess/conclusion (or guessclusion) is that the better that funnel is, the chances that video could be promoted in some way. Like, not sure if that is natural/organic or if they are doing that internally, like hey this video was reproduced completely for 90% of the people who watched it, ok, it has a greater score to show it more since they want users as engaged as possible. So, considering this, longer ambiguous videos worked worse to me than shorter to the point videos. 

Another thing to talk about is the call to action after the post, normally another post to the link to steam and the WISHLIST NOW kind of text. After doing different tests I am not super sure if it is needed or not, it is not clear for me since I had good wishlists from posts without the call to action and bad wishlist numbers from posts with the call to action. But my current conclusion is to always try to add it anyways since you don't lose so much and it is easier for the new interested people to find the link to click to add it, the only downside is that it is making super ultra clear that your initial post was to get more people and not just sharing something cool.

# THE WISHLISTS

SHOW WISHLISTS AND MAP EACH ACTION I TOOK

# Development Marketing Tools

* Dev scenes, cinematic tools, camera, etc, marketing image levels, etc.

 how I am modifying and/or doing some tools to easily do some marketing ideas, that could work more or less but still.

My approach to marketing is pretty naive and simple for now, just post videos/gifs of the game from time to time. 

## An example for the 2k wishlist post

VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS OF BEHIND THE SCENES?

One question that sometimes arises is, should I be spending all this dev time in marketing efforts? or maybe I should just switch to use that time to try to work more and use that money to pay for Ship Miner ads? I could also try to get a deal with a team and delegate marketing efforts and investment to them by sacrificing a % when the game gets released? Well, all of those options are not opposite between them so maybe I go with a combination but what I am sure is I am learning a lot by having more and better tools for marketing inside the game and I feel it is aligned with my long term investment pillar I decided when I started my company.

# Conclusions

One important conclusion is that a lot of times having luck is a big factor. So you can make a great post but if it isn't the right time, it will disappear in the aether. The opposite can happen to, you can do a shitty post and maybe it got a lot of visibility but got 0 reaction and ends up disappearing in the aether. So how do you know the post is good to keep trying. The answer is you don't know xD, and my conclusion is sometimes you have to try a couple of times if you believe in your post, and some others you are in charge of disappearing your post in the aether to not leave traces that it was really bad xD. 

Another important one is that, no matter how much effort I  put in this, having a good demo in steam will probably outpace by far all this small efforts, or maybe it will invalidate the game in some way.
