# Intro

I want to share part of my experience and learnings on how I am doing the marketing for Ship Miner.

My experience of doing "marketing" started before Ship Miner, while still finding which game to make. My approach at that time was simple, and it is similar to what I do nowadays, I just share images and videos of everything I did, mainly in Twitter/X and Mastodon at that time. 

On November 2023 I decided to also start sharing some stuff on Reddit, in particular the PixelArt subreddit, and did my [first post of a prototype of Ship Miner](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/17p7390/i_am_a_solodev_making_a_pixelart_1bit_space/). I believe I was super lucky with it and got great feedback for a pixelart game in a subreddit dedicated to pixelart.

While that post kinda worked on Reddit, on Twitter/X wasn't so direct and took some time. After a slow start without much hope, I finally got a [great tweet](#following-twitterx-trends). Between Reddit and Twitter I stated to feel more secure with its marketing potential so I decided to continue the development.

After finding the visual aesthetics of the game and kinda validated its marketing potential, it sounded reasonable to try to take advantage of that. My approach continued being similar but the objective changed from "trying to find something interesting to develop" to "try to get more visibility and convert interested players into steam wishlists".

# Following Twitter/X Trends

On May 2024 I decided to [join a twitter/x trend](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069) where you had to quote another tweet in the trend with a similar text and share something about your game. Doing this worked pretty well so I decided to try to join more trends in the future.

This is a list of some of the trends I joined:


* Twitter has updated their algorithm to allow users to see more posts from smaller accounts, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1789789080370258069)
* The indie game I am developing and the inspirations behind it, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1832173073577209932)
* Hi, Twitter! This is my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1844013314910855450)
* ATTENTION INDIE DEVS, show off your art style, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1905746314643833261)
* It will cost $0 to rt my game, [link](https://x.com/arielsan/status/1915764389422002210)

Some of them converted better than others but it was positive in general. I didn't find so many trends in other social networks and, when I joined, they didn't work so well for me.

# Social networks

Not so long ago, when Twitter/X was "going do die" and Bluesky and Threads started to get more and more interest, I decided to create my personal accounts and started to share Ship Miner content as well. Even though it was good to start having some presence there, if I compare them 1 to 1 to Twitter they were really initially. Obviously, I didn't have followers and had to build my presence there but I also believe the platforms were a bit green as well like you couldn't share GIFs, etc. 

After some months, both Bluesky and Threads started to improve getting more features and also more users. How are they doing now? Well, in my case, Bluesky has no explosive potential yet, at least for now, all my posts behave the same while the same posts did pretty well in other social networks. In the case of Threads, it started like I didn't exist to the world but at [some point I started to exist](https://www.threads.com/@ariel_coppes/post/DG9QtsgRdqk) and then it started to behave similar to Twitter/X (completely unexpected).

### Tubmlr?

I recently decided to start to interact a bit more on Tumblr too. The truth is I don't see a powerful marketing potential there but for some reason I like the community there, don't know why, I suppose it is more niche or something. So don't have any expectations there but I like it. 

### Discord

Not sure if I can call it investing in marketing or investing in community, or maybe in both but I tried to be  
Discord

## What about Reddit?

What happened to Reddit? that's a question I ask myself several times. Even though the initial good reaction was on Reddit, nowadays I am posting less frequent. Why? well, mainly because the reaction to my posts didn't match my expectations after the first successful post. I believe there are different reasons for that. 

One reason is I believe I had a good reaction the first time because it was the typical "hey I am a solo dev making this" which normally is well received while anything else that looks like "I want your wishlist" feels more like ads and reddit users (me included) don't like that so much. 

Another reason that might affect was that reddit UI changed and my lowres 1bit color game is less visible on first sight when scrolling through reddit posts. 

To take more advantage of Reddit I believe I should switch the approach and try something more natural and look for more interaction and feedback, for example sharing something I am doing like defining different enemy visual styles and explain why and ask for opinions, etc. That obviously will be more interesting to developers than players but I hope it will help in the long term.    

# General Marketing

One conclusion after testing different type of posts is that videos and GIFs work completely better than static images. I believe that conclusion applies to almost all games but for Ship Miner the difference is more obvious, it is more difficult to understand the game by looking at a static image. 

Comparing videos and GIFs, videos worked better for me, even considering most of my videos have no audio. Why? not super sure, could be just that the video controls are better, maybe it is the video compression (load faster on mobile devices), or maybe it is just the networks promoting more the videos than the GIFs, in the case of Twitter/X there are more analytics tools for videos like showing how many people watched until certain points, while with GIFs you don't have that. It might be a combination of all of those.

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/marketing/marketing_twitter_analytics.png" />
  <span>Funnel data for videos on Twitter/X</span>
</div>

The other guess/conclusion is that the better that funnel is, the chances that video could be promoted in some way. Like, not sure if that is natural/organic or if they are doing that internally, like hey this video was reproduced completely for 90% of the people who watched it, ok, it has a greater score to show it more since they want users as engaged to the platform as possible. So, considering this, longer ambiguous videos worked worse for me than shorter to the point videos. 

Another thing to talk about is the call to action. Normally, after the post there is a reply with the link to steam and the WISHLIST NOW call to action. After doing different tests I am not super sure if it is needed or not, it is not clear for me since I had good wishlists additions from posts without the call to action and bad wishlist additions from posts with the call to action. But my current conclusion is to always try to add it anyways since you don't lose so much and it is easier for the potential players to find the link to Steam. The only downside is making super ultra clear that your initial post was to get wishlists and not just sharing something cool.

# Wishlists

This is the graph of wishlists since I created the Steam page.

_TODO: map each moment with some action I took._


# Development Marketing Tools

* Dev scenes, cinematic tools, camera, etc, marketing image levels, etc.

 how I am modifying and/or doing some tools to easily do some marketing ideas, that could work more or less but still.

My approach to marketing is pretty naive and simple for now, just post videos/gifs of the game from time to time. 

## An example for the 2k wishlist post

VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS OF BEHIND THE SCENES?

One question that sometimes arises is, should I be spending all this dev time in marketing efforts? or maybe I should just switch to use that time to try to work more and use that money to pay for Ship Miner ads? I could also try to get a deal with a team and delegate marketing efforts and investment to them by sacrificing a % when the game gets released? Well, all of those options are not opposite between them so maybe I go with a combination but what I am sure is I am learning a lot by having more and better tools for marketing inside the game and I feel it is aligned with my long term investment pillar I decided when I started my company.

# Conclusions

One important conclusion is that a lot of times having luck is a big factor. So you can make a great post but if it isn't the right time, it will disappear in the aether. The opposite can happen to, you can do a shitty post and maybe it got a lot of visibility but got 0 reaction and ends up disappearing in the aether. So how do you know the post is good to keep trying. The answer is you don't know xD, and my conclusion is sometimes you have to try a couple of times if you believe in your post, and some others you are in charge of disappearing your post in the aether to not leave traces that it was really bad xD. 

Participating in other communities and building a community feels like super related with doing marketing as well but in a more indirect way.

Another important one is that, no matter how much effort I  put in this, having a good demo in steam will probably outpace by far all this small efforts, or maybe it will invalidate the game in some way.
