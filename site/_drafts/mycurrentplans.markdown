This blog post is just an update on what I am doing right now and how my plans changed.

Recently, I created these prototypes: [Beatemup](https://arielsan.itch.io/beatemup), [Stranded: Planet Survivor](https://arielsan.itch.io/stranded-planet-survivor) and [Hunter Games](https://arielsan.itch.io/huntersgame) and also participated in a LDJAM with a game named [Spice Must Flow](https://arielsan.itch.io/spice-must-flow). I also worked with friends in making a Super Crate Box like platformer prototype but wasn't published because we decided to stop it for now.

So, I continue with my plan of making mini games or prototypes to keep learning and finding what I want to work on and compromise in mid to long term but at the same time I now have other things too.

First of all, I'm starting teaching "Programaci√≥n de Videojuegos" at ORT University in Uruguay. It is my first time as a University teacher and I am exited about it. This subject is like an introduction to videogames for advanced computer engineer students, so I can assume good programming knowledge (data structures, algorithms, etc), which is good for the course, and the idea is to give some technical approach to games but also a gameplay approach which is something they are probably not used to. 

Also, I started working in a web app project for some friends. Even though it is not related to games, it allows me to decide how many hours to spend so I can balance between work and game development while having some income. The project uses Ionic toolkit with Angular for the frontend, among other things, and Firebase and CouchDB for the backend, among other things. It is very interesting and I am learning a lot, and I believe I can use the knowledge to make some webapp ideas I have, at some point in the future.

That's all for now, my game dev dream is intact :)
