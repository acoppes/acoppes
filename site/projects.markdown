<!-- 
The idea of this page is to highlight some of the projects I've worked on, stuff that I am proud to show
* Could explain a bit each game, one liner.

**[Work in progress]**

This page shows some of my most recent and/or important projects I've worked on.

Find my open source projects and tools and other collaborations at my personal <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username| cgi_escape | escape }}"><span class="username">Github</span></a> page. For example, I have a plugin for Unity, released to [openupm](https://openupm.com/), to store and show the user's selection history, check it [here](https://github.com/acoppes/unity-history-window).

My development blog is hosted at <a href="{{site.dev_blog}}">Gemserk</a>.
