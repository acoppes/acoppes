Want to work together?

Right now I am trying to make my own games but that doesn't mean we can't work together. You can contact me to publish one of my games if you want :) or to make a partnership.

You can hire me to:
* Analyze and solve high level problems, for example, you need to add path finding to a game.
* Improve processes and tools when scaling games and teams, for example, you are a growing team slowed down by your workflow like importing assets in the project. 
* Code technical solutions

What I'm sure, though, is that I'm not looking for a full time job at the moment **unless** I find a dream job.

Just send me an email to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or contact me via:
