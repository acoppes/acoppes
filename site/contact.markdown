Want to work together?

Right now I am trying to make my own games but that doesn't mean we can't work together. You can contact me to publish one of my games if you want :) or to make a partnership.

I also can help small studios by giving advice and/or help with processes and tools improvement when scaling up games and teams or even to code specific technical solutions.

What I'm sure, though, is that I'm not looking for a full time job at the moment, **unless** I find a dream job.

Just send me an email to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or contact me via:
