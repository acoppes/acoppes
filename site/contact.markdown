Want to work together or hire me?

Right now I am pretty full working on Cleared Hot part time and the rest of the time on my own game Ship Miner, among other activities. 

When not super busy, you could contact me to:

* Analyze and solve high level problems, for example, you need to add path finding to a game.
* Improve processes and tools when scaling games and teams, for example, you are a growing team slowed down by your workflow like importing assets in the project. 
* Code technical solutions.

<!-- What I'm sure, though, is that I'm not looking for a full time job at the moment **unless** I find a dream job. -->

Just send me an email to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or contact me via:
