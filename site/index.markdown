<!-- The idea here is to show who am I and what I stand for in terms of game development and engineering and what are my main skills -->

I'm a father of two, 40 years old, Game Developer and Software Engineer with passion for games and programming and 14 years of experience in game development and 3.5+ years in software. 

Recently, I started my own company named [Pixel Core Games](https://x.com/pixelcoregames) and I am developing [Ship Miner](https://shipminer.arielcoppes.dev), a 1 bit low res pixelart sci fi miner game.   

I've started playing games when I was a kid and I knew at that time I wanted to make them. I really enjoy playing all kind of games, I tried to think in a favorite genre but as far as I remember I played lots of different genres during my life and enjoyed practically all of them.  

Even though my main focus is making games, I enjoy a lot scaling them up by improving workflows, tools and development processes to increase speed and simplify making big games with smalls teams.

Site map:

* Want to work together? check the [Contact](/contact) page to decide how to contact me.
* Check out the [Games](/projects) I've worked on to see what I do and also the mini games and prototypes from the [Game Jams](/jams) I've participated. 
* For technical content you can check out my dev [Blog](/blog) page. I've also generated technical content over the years in my old dev blog at [Gemserk](https://blog.gemserk.com) website.

<!-- * And at the [Work](/work) page I will share specific things I did while working at different projects. -->

So after the years working on different teams, with different people, in different contexts and on different projects, I know that I consider the following values important and kinda defines how I want to work from now on:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as peers.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment.
* Generate trust by being Transparent and by having good Communication.

<!-- 
My skills

* Focus
* Analytic
* Hard work
-->

I really like the [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) principles too and some of my favorite development practices are:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming (in game dev, I prefer the name Pair working in something, could be a programmer or an artist or whatever)
