<!-- The idea here is to show who am I and what I stand for in terms of game development and engineering and what are my main skills -->

I'm a 39 years old Game Developer and Software Engineer with passion for games and programming and 14 years of experience in game development 3.5+ years in software.

I've started playing games when I was a kid and I knew at that time I wanted to make them. I really enjoy playing all kind of games, I tried to think in a favorite genre but as far as I remember I played lots of different genres during my life and enjoyed practically all of them.  

Even though my main focus is making games, I enjoy a lot scaling them up by improving workflows, tools and development processes to increase speed and simplify making big games with smalls teams. I suppose that is my inner Engineer taking control of me.

Site map:

* Want to work together? check the [Contact](/contact) page to decide how to contact me.
* Check out the [Projects](/projects) I worked on to see what I do, also the [Game Jams](/jams) I've participated. 
* If you want more detail, you can check out the [Blog](/blog) page to see some development blog posts I did over the years at [Gemserk](https://blog.gemserk.com) website.

<!-- * And at the [Work](/work) page I will share specific things I did while working at different projects. -->

So after the years working on different teams, with different people, in different contexts and on different projects, I know that I consider the following values important and kinda defines how I want to work from now on:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as peers.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment.
* Generate trust by being Transparent and through good Communication.

<!-- 
My skills

* Focus
* Analytic
* Hard work
-->

I really like the [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) principles too and some of my favorite development practices are:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming (in game dev, I prefer the name Pair working in something, could be a programmer or an artist or whatever)
