**[Work in progress]**

<!-- The idea here is to show who am I and what I stand for in terms of game development and engineering and what are my main skills -->

[TODO] Share more about me here, who I am and what I do or something like that.

I'm a 38 years old Game Developer and Software Engineer with passion for games and programming and 13 years of professional experience in game development.

I've started playing games when I was really young and I immediately knew I wanted to make games. I really enjoy playing all kind of games, I tried to think in a favorite genre but as I remember, I played lots of different genre games during my life.  

I have a good long term vision for games and I think from the beginning how games scale and since I am an engineer I love to improve workflow by making tools and automating tasks to increase development speed.

More about me:

* Want to contact me about anything work related? check the [Contact](/contact) page.
* Check the [Projects](/projects) page to see some of the projects I worked on. 
* At [Blog](/blog) page you can see some development blog posts I did over the years at [Gemserk](https://blog.gemserk.com), and hope to add new blog posts in the future.

<!-- * And at the [Work](/work) page I will share specific things I did while working at different projects. -->

When working in teams I believe in:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as peers.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment.
* Generate trust by being Transparent and through good Communication.

<!-- 
My skills

* Focus
* Analytic
* Hard work
-->

I really like the [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) principles too and some of my favorite development best practices are:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming (in game dev, I prefer the name Pair working in something, could be a programmer or an artist or whatever)
