**This is a work in progress**

Game Developer and Engineer with passion for games and programming and more than 13 years of professional experience.

Some of my core values:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as pairs and by generating space to talk.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment by listening to each other and removing waste.
* Generate trust by being transparent and having good communication skills.
* I don't believe in separated roles with separated responsibilities but I do believe in having different knowledge and points of view and achieving excellence by interacting to find the best value from them. 

I believe in [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/), some of my favorite development best practices:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming (in game dev, I prefer the name Pair working in something, could be a programmer or an artist or whatever)
