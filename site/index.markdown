**[Work in progress]**

<!-- The idea here is to show who am I and what I stand for in terms of game development and engineering and what are my main skills -->

[TODO] Share more about me here, who I am and what I do or something like that, before core value statements.

Game Developer and Software Engineer with passion for games and programming and more than 13 years of professional experience.

I've started playing games when I was really young (around five years old) and I immediately knew I wanted to make games for a living. I enjoy playing all kind of games but I fell in love with the RTS genre with Dune 2 and Warcraft when I was ten years old.  

I have a good long term vision for games and I think from the beginning how games scale and since I am an engineer I love to improve workflow by making tools and automating tasks to increase development speed.

More about me:

* Want to contact me about anything work related? check the [Contact](/contact) page.
* Check the [Projects](/projects) page to see some of the projects I worked on. 
* At [Blog](/blog) page you can see some development blog posts I did over the years at [Gemserk](https://blog.gemserk.com), and hope to add new blog posts in the future.

<!-- * And at the [Work](/work) page I will share specific things I did while working at different projects. -->

When working in teams I believe in:

* Collaboration, teamwork and growing together.
* Psychological safety by treating others and being treated as peers.
* Continuous improvement and empowerment.
* Generate trust by being Transparent and having good Communication skills.

<!-- 
My skills

* Focus
* Analytic
* Hard work
-->

I believe in [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/), some of my favorite development best practices:

* Continuous delivery
* Test driven development
* Pair programming (in game dev, I prefer the name Pair working in something, could be a programmer or an artist or whatever)
